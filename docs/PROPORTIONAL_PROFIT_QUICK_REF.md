# Quick Reference: Proportional Profit Calculation

## 🎯 What Changed

**Before:** Outstanding credit profit = 100% of PENDING/PARTIAL sales profit  
**After:** Outstanding credit profit = Profit × (Amount Due / Total Amount)  

## 📊 New API Field

```json
GET /api/sales/summary/
{
  "summary": {
    "realized_credit_profit": "25000.00"  // 🆕 NEW
  }
}
```

## 💡 Key Formula

```
For each PARTIAL credit sale:
  Outstanding Profit = Sale Profit × (Amount Due ÷ Total Amount)
  Realized Profit = Sale Profit × (Amount Paid ÷ Total Amount)
```

## 📈 Example

**Sale:** $1,000 total, $300 profit, 40% paid ($400)

**Old:**
- Outstanding: $300 (100%)
- Cash on Hand: $0

**New:**
- Outstanding: $180 (60%)
- Realized: $120 (40%)
- Cash on Hand: **+$120** ✅

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Customer makes payment on credit sale
2. `amount_paid` increases, `amount_due` decreases
3. Profit splits proportionally:
   - Realized portion → **Cash on Hand** ⬆️
   - Outstanding portion → **Outstanding Credit** ⬇️
4. Updates automatically, no manual intervention

## ✅ Benefits

- ✅ Accurate cash on hand (includes partial payment profits)
- ✅ Better financial visibility
- ✅ Automatic updates with each payment
- ✅ Aligns with revenue-based accounting
