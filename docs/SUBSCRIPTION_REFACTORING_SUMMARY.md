# 🎉 Subscription System Refactoring - COMPLETE

## Status: ✅ Backend Complete | ⏳ Frontend Integration Needed

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Impact:** Breaking Changes - Frontend updates required  
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## � KEY CLARIFICATION

**IMPORTANT: Understand Business vs Storefront**

- **Business** = Company/Organization (e.g., "DataLogique Systems")
  - Has **ONE** subscription
  - Can have **MULTIPLE** storefronts/shops/branches
  - Subscription covers **ALL** storefronts

- **Storefront/Shop** = Physical location/branch (e.g., "Accra Branch", "Kumasi Branch")
  - Multiple storefronts belong to ONE business
  - **NO** individual subscriptions per storefront
  - All covered by the business's single subscription

**What Changed:**
- **Before:** User could effectively only own ONE business
- **After:** User can own MULTIPLE businesses (each business has its own subscription)

**Example:**
```
John (User)
  ├─ DataLogique Systems (Business) → ONE Premium Subscription
  │    ├─ Accra Branch (Storefront)
  │    ├─ Kumasi Branch (Storefront)
  │    └─ Tamale Branch (Storefront)
  │
  └─ Tech Solutions Ltd (Different Business) → Separate Basic Subscription
       └─ Tema Branch (Storefront)
```
