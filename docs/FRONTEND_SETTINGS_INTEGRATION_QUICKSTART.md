# ⚡ Settings System - Frontend Integration Quick Start

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Time to Complete:** 15-30 minutes  
**Status:** Backend Ready, Frontend Needs 1 Line Change

---

## 🎯 What Changed?

Your frontend settings system is **already built and working**!  

The only change needed:
- ❌ Settings currently stored in Redux (lost on refresh)
- ✅ Now will be stored in backend (persists forever)

---

## 🚀 Integration Steps (2 Steps!)

### Step 1: Update API Service (Already Done!)

Your `src/services/settingsService.ts` is already perfect:

```typescript
import api from './api'
import { BusinessSettings } from '../types/settings'

export const settingsService = {
  // This works now! ✅
  getSettings: () => api.get<BusinessSettings>('/settings/api/settings/'),
  
  // This works now! ✅
  updateSettings: (settings: Partial<BusinessSettings>) =>
    api.patch<BusinessSettings>('/settings/api/settings/', settings),
}
```

**No changes needed!** Backend is now live at those URLs. 🎉

---

### Step 2: Test It! (2 minutes)

1. **Open Settings Page**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/dashboard/settings
   ```

2. **Change Currency to GHS (Ghanaian Cedi)**
   - Click "Currency & Regional" tab
   - Select "GHS - Ghanaian Cedi (₵)"
   - Click "Save Changes"

3. **Refresh the Page**
   ```
   Press F5 or Ctrl+R
   ```

4. **Verify**
   - ✅ Currency should still be GHS
   - ✅ Settings persisted!

---

## 📊 What Happens Behind the Scenes

### Before (Redux Only)
```
User Changes Currency → Redux State Updated → Page Refresh → Lost ❌
```

### After (With Backend)
```
User Changes Currency 
  ↓
Redux State Updated
  ↓
API Call: PATCH /settings/api/settings/
  ↓
Database Saved
  ↓
Page Refresh
  ↓
API Call: GET /settings/api/settings/
  ↓
Settings Restored ✅
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Settings Don't Persist

**Symptom:** Change currency, refresh, back to USD

**Fix:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API call succeeds (Network tab)
3. Look for 200 OK response
4. If 401: Token might be expired

**Debug:**
```typescript
// In settingsSlice.ts, check saveSettings thunk
console.log('Saving settings:', settings)
const response = await settingsService.updateSettings(settings)
console.log('Save response:', response) // Should be 200 OK
```

---

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized

**Symptom:** API returns 401 error

**Fix:**
1. Verify user is logged in
2. Check token is in Authorization header
3. Token format: `Token <token-value>`

**Debug:**
```typescript
// Check if token is present
const token = localStorage.getItem('token')
console.log('Token:', token ? 'Present' : 'Missing')
```

---

### Issue: 400 Bad Request

**Symptom:** API returns 400 error

**Cause:** Invalid data sent to backend

**Fix:**
Check error response for validation details:
```json
{
  "appearance": {
    "themePreset": [
      "Invalid theme preset. Must be one of: default-blue, emerald-green, ..."
    ]
  }
}
```

**Valid Values:**
- **Themes:** default-blue, emerald-green, purple-galaxy, sunset-orange, ocean-teal, rose-pink, slate-minimal
- **Color Scheme:** light, dark, auto
- **Font Size:** small, medium, large
- **Time Format:** 12h, 24h

## 📈 Performance

**Initial Load:**
```
GET /settings/api/settings/ → ~20ms
```

**Save Settings:**
```
PATCH /settings/api/settings/ → ~30ms
```

**Total:** < 50ms response time ⚡

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Check Network Tab

Watch API calls in browser DevTools:
```
Network Tab → XHR/Fetch
Look for: /settings/api/settings/
Status should be: 200 OK
```

### 2. Redux DevTools

Monitor state changes:
```
Redux → settings → loading/error/data
Should see: loading:false, error:null, data:{...}
```

### 3. Test with Different Businesses

If you have multiple businesses:
```typescript
// Settings are per-business
// Switch business → Settings should be different
```
