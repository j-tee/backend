## Usage Examples

### 1. Record Theft (3 lines of code)

```python
adjustment = StockAdjustment.objects.create(
    stock_product=product,
    adjustment_type='THEFT',
    quantity=5,  # Auto-corrected to -5
    reason='Items missing after security check',
    reference_number='POLICE-2025-001'
)
# Status: PENDING (requires approval)
```

### 2. Handle Damaged Goods (with photo)

```python
# Create adjustment
adjustment = StockAdjustment.objects.create(
    stock_product=product,
    adjustment_type='DAMAGE',
    quantity=10,
    reason='Forklift accident damaged boxes'
)

# Upload photo
StockAdjustmentPhoto.objects.create(
    adjustment=adjustment,
    photo=photo_file,
    description='Damaged boxes'
)
```

### 3. Physical Count with Auto-Adjustments

```python
# Create count
count = StockCount.objects.create(
    storefront=storefront,
    count_date=today
)

# Add items (system auto-calculates discrepancies)
StockCountItem.objects.create(
    stock_count=count,
    stock_product=product,
    counted_quantity=48  # System: 50, Discrepancy: -2
)

# Complete and generate adjustments
count.complete()
for item in count.items.exclude(discrepancy=0):
    item.create_adjustment(user)
```

### 4. Customer Return (auto-approved)

```python
# Auto-approved, immediately adds stock back
adjustment = StockAdjustment.objects.create(
    stock_product=product,
    adjustment_type='CUSTOMER_RETURN',
    quantity=2,
    related_sale=sale
)
# Status: COMPLETED (auto)
```

---

## API Examples

### Create Adjustment

```bash
POST /inventory/api/stock-adjustments/
```

```json
{
  "stock_product": "uuid",
  "adjustment_type": "DAMAGE",
  "quantity": 10,
  "reason": "Boxes fell and broke bottles"
}
```

**Auto-Features:**
- `business` - from user's membership
- `created_by` - current user
- `quantity` - sign auto-corrected (-10 for DAMAGE)
- `unit_cost` - from stock_product if not provided
- `requires_approval` - auto-determined
- `status` - PENDING or APPROVED

### Get Shrinkage Report

```bash
GET /inventory/api/stock-adjustments/shrinkage/
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "overall": {
    "total_units": 95,
    "total_cost": "2850.00",
    "total_incidents": 25
  },
  "by_type": [
    {"adjustment_type": "THEFT", "count": 12, "total_cost": "1200.00"},
    {"adjustment_type": "DAMAGE", "count": 8, "total_cost": "850.00"}
  ],
  "top_affected_products": [...]
}
```

### Approve Pending

```bash
POST /inventory/api/stock-adjustments/{id}/approve/
```

Auto-completes if no further approval needed, updating stock immediately.

---

## Approval Logic

### Auto-Approved ✅
- `CUSTOMER_RETURN` (low risk)
- `TRANSFER_IN/OUT` (system-generated)
- Low-value adjustments

### Requires Approval ⚠️
- `THEFT` (security concern)
- `LOSS` (security concern)
- `WRITE_OFF` (financial impact)
- Adjustments > $1000

### Status Flow

```
CREATE → PENDING → APPROVED → COMPLETED
          ↓
       REJECTED
```

Or for auto-approved:

```
CREATE → APPROVED → COMPLETED (auto)
```

---

## Reporting Capabilities

### 1. Adjustment Summary
- Total count, increases, decreases
- Financial impact
- By type, by status

### 2. Shrinkage Analysis
- Total shrinkage (THEFT, LOSS, DAMAGE, etc.)
- Cost breakdown
- Top affected products
- Incident trends

### 3. Product History
- All adjustments for product
- Total shrinkage for product
- Pending adjustments

### 4. Count Variance
- Discrepancy analysis
- Accuracy metrics
- Value impact

---

## Integration Points

### StockProduct Methods Added

```python
# Get adjustment summary
product.get_adjustment_summary()
# Returns: {summary: {...}, by_type: [...]}

# Get total shrinkage
product.get_shrinkage_total()
# Returns: {units: 25, cost: Decimal('375.00')}

# Get pending adjustments
product.get_pending_adjustments()
# Returns: QuerySet of PENDING/APPROVED adjustments
```

### Stock Updates

When adjustment is **COMPLETED**:
```python
adjustment.complete()
# Updates: stock_product.quantity += adjustment.quantity
# Validates: Cannot go below zero
# Tracks: completed_at timestamp
```

---

## Security & Multi-Tenancy

### Business Scoping
- All queries filtered by user's active business
- Cannot see/modify other businesses' data
- Business auto-set from BusinessMembership

### Audit Trail
Every adjustment tracks:
- `created_by` - who created
- `approved_by` - who approved
- `created_at` - when created
- `approved_at` - when approved
- `completed_at` - when applied to stock

### Permissions
- User must have active BusinessMembership
- Stock product must belong to user's business
- Only PENDING can be approved
- Only APPROVED can be completed

---

## Testing Results
