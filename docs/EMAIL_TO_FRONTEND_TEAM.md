Priority: HIGH

Hi Frontend Team,

We've completed a critical architectural refactoring of the subscription system that requires immediate frontend updates. This is a **BREAKING CHANGE**.

## What Changed?

The subscription system has been refactored from **USER-CENTRIC** to **BUSINESS-CENTRIC**:

- **Before:** Subscriptions belonged to users (limiting users to one business)
- **After:** Subscriptions belong to businesses (users can manage multiple businesses)

## Why?

The old architecture prevented users from owning/managing multiple businesses with separate subscriptions. The new architecture allows:
- ‚úÖ One user can manage unlimited businesses
- ‚úÖ Each business has its own subscription
- ‚úÖ Each business has its own subscription status and limits
- ‚úÖ Proper business-based access control

## Action Required

### Immediate Changes (Day 1):

1. **Add `business_id` to subscription creation:**
```javascript
// OLD ‚ùå
api.post('/subscriptions/', { plan_id })

// NEW ‚úÖ
api.post('/subscriptions/', { plan_id, business_id })
```

2. **Move subscription status from User to Business:**
```javascript
// OLD ‚ùå
user.subscription_status

// NEW ‚úÖ
business.subscription_status
```

3. **Add business context to subscription queries:**
```javascript
// OLD ‚ùå
api.get('/subscriptions/me/')

// NEW ‚úÖ
api.get(`/subscriptions/me/?business_id=${businessId}`)
```

### New Features to Implement:

4. **Business selector component** (users can switch between businesses)
5. **Track current business** in app state
6. **Load all user's businesses** on login

## Documentation

We've created three documents for you:

1. **FRONTEND_QUICK_START.md** - Quick fixes (5 minutes read)
2. **FRONTEND_SUBSCRIPTION_CHANGES.md** - Complete guide (all details)
3. **SUBSCRIPTION_ARCHITECTURE_FIX_COMPLETED.md** - Technical background

**Start with FRONTEND_QUICK_START.md** ‚ö°

## API Changes Summary

| Endpoint | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Create subscription | `{plan_id}` | `{plan_id, business_id}` ‚úÖ |
| Get subscription | `/subscriptions/me/` | `/subscriptions/me/?business_id=X` ‚úÖ |
| User object | Has `subscription_status` | No subscription_status ‚ùå |
| Business object | No subscription info | Has `subscription_status` ‚úÖ |

## Testing Support

We can help test the integration. Please:
