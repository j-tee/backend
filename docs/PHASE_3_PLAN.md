- Profit: FROM `Sale.total_profit` âœ…
- Accounts Receivable: FROM `Customer` credit transactions âœ…
- Payments: FROM `Payment` model âœ…
- Cash Flow: FROM sales and payments âœ…

### Tier 2: Future Enhancement (Later)
**When Bookkeeping Matures:**
- Detailed expense tracking
- Full P&L statements
- Balance sheet integration
- Complete accrual accounting
- Budget vs actual analysis

## Implementation Plan

### Week 5: Revenue & Profit + AR Aging

#### Days 1-2: Revenue & Profit Analysis Report
**File:** `reports/views/financial_reports.py`

**Implementation:**
```python
class RevenueProfitReportView(BaseReportView):
    """Revenue and Profit Analysis"""
    
    def get(self, request):
        # Get business, date range
        # Query sales with profit calculations
        # Group by period (daily/weekly/monthly)
        # Calculate margins
        # Build summary and results
```

**Key Calculations:**
- Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
- Gross Margin = (Gross Profit / Revenue) Ã— 100
- Group by sale_type, payment_method
- Trend analysis over time

#### Days 3-4: AR Aging Report
**File:** `reports/views/financial_reports.py`

**Implementation:**
```python
class ARAgingReportView(BaseReportView):
    """Accounts Receivable Aging Analysis"""
    
    def get(self, request):
        # Get customers with credit balances
        # Calculate days outstanding for each
        # Bucket into aging categories
        # Calculate risk levels
        # Build aging summary
```

**Key Calculations:**
- Days Outstanding = Today - Last Credit Transaction Date
- Aging Buckets: Current, 1-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+
- Credit Utilization = Balance / Credit Limit
- Risk Level: low, medium, high based on age and amount

### Week 6: Collection Rates + Cash Flow

#### Days 1-2: Collection Rates Report
**File:** `reports/views/financial_reports.py`

**Implementation:**
```python
class CollectionRatesReportView(BaseReportView):
    """Payment Collection Analysis"""
    
    def get(self, request):
        # Get credit sales in period
        # Get payments against credit
        # Calculate collection rates
        # Track average collection time
        # Group by period
```

**Key Calculations:**
- Collection Rate = (Collected / Credit Issued) Ã— 100
- Avg Collection Days = Sum(days_to_collect) / Count(payments)
- Collection Efficiency: Excellent (>95%), Good (85-95%), Fair (75-85%), Poor (<75%)

#### Days 3-4: Cash Flow Report
**File:** `reports/views/financial_reports.py`

**Implementation:**
```python
class CashFlowReportView(BaseReportView):
    """Cash Flow Analysis (Inflows)"""
    
    def get(self, request):
        # Get all payments (inflows)
        # Group by period
        # Calculate running balance
        # Track by payment method
        # Build cash flow statement
```

**Key Calculations:**
- Total Inflows = Sum(all payments)
- Net Cash Flow = Inflows - Outflows (outflows = 0 for now)
- Running Balance = Previous Balance + Net Flow
- Group by payment method

### Week 7-8: Testing, Polish & Integration

#### Testing:
- Unit tests for all 4 reports
- Edge cases (no data, negative margins, etc.)
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Validation of calculations

#### Polish:
- Error messages and validation
- Documentation updates
- Code review and refactoring
- Query optimization

#### Integration:
- Update URLs
- Test all endpoints
- Frontend documentation
- API examples

## URL Updates

Add to `reports/urls.py`:

```python
# Financial Reports (Phase 3)
path('api/financial/revenue-profit/', RevenueProfitReportView.as_view(), name='revenue-profit-report'),
path('api/financial/ar-aging/', ARAgingReportView.as_view(), name='ar-aging-report'),
path('api/financial/collection-rates/', CollectionRatesReportView.as_view(), name='collection-rates-report'),
path('api/financial/cash-flow/', CashFlowReportView.as_view(), name='cash-flow-report'),
```

---

## Success Criteria

By end of Phase 3:
- âœ… 4/4 Financial reports functional
- âœ… AR aging with proper bucketing
- âœ… Collection rates calculated correctly
- âœ… Cash flow tracking (inflows)
- âœ… Revenue and profit analysis complete
- âœ… All tests passing
- âœ… Documentation updated

**Progress:** 8/16 total reports (50%)

---

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Simplified Approach
- Focus on sales/payment data (exists)
- Skip expense tracking initially (can add later)
- Cash flow = inflows only for now

### 2. AR Aging Methodology
- Use customer credit balance
- Calculate from last transaction date
- 5 aging buckets (industry standard)

### 3. Collection Rates
- Track credit sales vs payments
- Calculate average collection period
- Provide efficiency scoring

### 4. Future-Proof Design
- Easy to add expense tracking later
- Room for full P&L statements
- Can integrate with bookkeeping module
