# Product Implementation Changes Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the major refactoring of the product and inventory system that shifted from product-centric pricing to stock-based pricing. The changes were implemented to provide more granular cost tracking, supplier-specific pricing, and better inventory management capabilities.

## Key Changes

### 1. Product Model Simplification

**Before:**
- Products contained `retail_price`, `wholesale_price`, and `cost` fields
- Pricing was static at the product level

**After:**
- Products are now "metadata only" for selling prices
- Removed `retail_price`, `wholesale_price`, and `cost` fields from Product model
- Products now focus on catalog information (name, SKU, category, unit, description)

### 2. Stock Model Refactoring

**Before:**
- Single `Stock` model represented individual stock items
- Each stock record was tied to a specific product with pricing

**After:**
- Split into two models:
  - `Stock`: Represents stock batches (containers for organizing inventory)
  - `StockProduct`: Represents individual stock line items with supplier-specific data

### 3. New Supplier Model

**Added:**
- `Supplier` model to track supplier information
- Fields: name, contact_person, email, phone_number, address, notes
- Stock products can now be linked to specific suppliers

### 4. Enhanced Cost Tracking

**New Cost Fields in StockProduct:**
- `unit_cost`: Base cost per unit
- `unit_tax_rate`: Tax rate percentage (0-100%)
- `unit_tax_amount`: Calculated or manually set tax amount
- `unit_additional_cost`: Additional costs (shipping, handling, etc.)
- `retail_price`: Suggested retail selling price per unit
- `wholesale_price`: Suggested wholesale selling price per unit

**Calculated Properties:**
- `landed_unit_cost`: Total cost per unit including all taxes and additional costs
- `total_base_cost`: Total base cost for all units
- `total_tax_amount`: Total tax for all units
- `total_additional_cost`: Total additional costs for all units
- `total_landed_cost`: Total landed cost for all units

### 5. Database Schema Changes

**Migration Consolidation:**
- Removed intermediate migrations that were no longer needed
- Consolidated schema changes into cleaner migration files
- Updated foreign key relationships to use new model structure

**New Tables:**
- `suppliers`: Supplier information
- `stock_batches`: Stock batch containers (renamed from `stock_batches`)
- `stock`: Individual stock items (renamed from `stock`)

**Updated Relationships:**
- `Inventory.stock` now references `StockProduct` instead of `Stock`
- `Transfer.stock` updated to reference `StockProduct`
- `SaleItem.stock_product` field added for direct StockProduct reference (preferred for profit margin calculations)
- `SaleItem.stock` field maintained for backward compatibility

### 6. API Changes

**New Endpoints:**
- `/inventory/api/stock-products/`: CRUD for individual stock items
- `/inventory/api/suppliers/`: CRUD for suppliers
- `/inventory/api/owner/workspace/`: Owner workspace overview

**Updated Serializers:**
- `ProductSerializer`: Removed pricing fields
- `StockSerializer`: Now represents stock batches with nested items
- `StockProductSerializer`: New serializer for individual stock items
- `SupplierSerializer`: New serializer for suppliers

**Enhanced Inventory Serializer:**
- Added `stock_arrival_date` and `stock_supplier` methods
- Updated to work with new stock structure

**API Enhancements (Latest):**
- **Pagination**: All inventory endpoints now support pagination with configurable page sizes (default: 25, max: 100)
- **Filtering**: Comprehensive filtering capabilities across all inventory ViewSets
- **Ordering**: Flexible ordering options for all inventory endpoints

# Stock products with advanced filtering
GET /inventory/api/stock-products/?page=1&page_size=50&supplier=<uuid>&has_quantity=true&search=widget&ordering=-created_at

# Stock batches for specific warehouse
GET /inventory/api/stock/?warehouse=<uuid>&ordering=-arrival_date&page_size=20

# Suppliers with search
GET /inventory/api/suppliers/?search=acme&ordering=name
```

**Business Scoping:**
All endpoints maintain proper business scoping for multi-tenant architecture, ensuring users only see data from their authorized businesses.

**Performance Considerations:**
- Optimized database queries with select_related and prefetch_related
- Efficient filtering and ordering to minimize database load
- Pagination prevents large result sets from impacting performance

### 6.2 Critical Security Enhancement: Business Scoping Implementation

**Security Vulnerability Identified:**
A critical multi-tenant data isolation vulnerability was discovered where Product, Stock, and Supplier models were not properly scoped to businesses, allowing potential data leakage between different business owners in the SaaS platform.

**Changes Implemented:**
- **Product Model**: Added required `business` foreign key field with unique constraint on `(business, sku)`
- **Supplier Model**: Added required `business` foreign key field with unique constraint on `(business, name)`
- **View Security**: Updated `ProductViewSet` and `SupplierViewSet` with business scoping logic
- **Permission Checks**: Implemented `_business_ids_for_user()` and `_get_primary_business_for_owner()` helper methods
- **Data Migration**: Created migration to assign existing products to "DataLogique Systems" business and make business fields non-nullable

**Security Benefits:**
- **Data Isolation**: Users can only access products and suppliers belonging to their authorized businesses
- **Prevention of Data Leakage**: Eliminates cross-business data access vulnerabilities
- **Compliance**: Ensures proper multi-tenant data separation required for SaaS platforms
- **Audit Trail**: Business relationships provide clear ownership tracking

**Database Changes:**
- Added `business_id` foreign key to `products` and `suppliers` tables
- Created unique constraints to prevent duplicate SKUs per business and supplier names per business
- Applied data migration to assign existing data to appropriate business

**API Security:**
- All product and supplier endpoints now automatically filter by user's business permissions
- Permission checks prevent unauthorized access to business data
- Proper error responses for forbidden access attempts

**Testing Updates:**
- Updated test fixtures to include business creation and assignment
- Added business scoping validation tests
- Ensured all existing functionality works with business constraints

### 7. Business Logic Updates

**Cost Calculation:**
- Automatic tax amount calculation when `unit_tax_rate` is provided
- Comprehensive cost breakdown properties for analysis

**Stock Organization:**
- Stock batches group related stock items by arrival date and warehouse
- Better tracking of inventory receipts and organization

**Supplier Tracking:**
- Cost variations by supplier
- Supplier-specific stock tracking
- Enhanced reporting capabilities

### 8. Admin Interface Updates

**Product Admin:**
- Removed pricing fields from product admin
- Simplified to focus on catalog management

**Stock Admin:**
- Split into `StockAdmin` (batches) and `StockProductAdmin` (items)
- Enhanced fieldsets for cost management
- Better organization of cost-related fields

**New Supplier Admin:**
- Full CRUD for supplier management
- Search and filtering capabilities

### 9. Testing Updates

**Model Tests:**

- **Search Tests**: Testing of search functionality across relevant fields
- **Performance Tests**: Ensuring pagination prevents large result sets

### 10. Reporting Updates

**Inventory Valuation:**
- Updated to work with new stock structure
- Enhanced cost calculation using landed costs
- Better supplier and batch tracking in reports

### 11. Profit Margin Calculations

**SaleItem Profit Analysis:**
- Added `unit_cost` property that prioritizes `stock_product.landed_unit_cost` for accurate cost tracking
- Added `profit_amount` property: `unit_price - unit_cost`
- Added `profit_margin` property: `((unit_price - unit_cost) / unit_price) * 100`
- Added `total_profit_amount` property: `profit_amount * quantity`
- Cost calculation hierarchy:
  1. Direct `stock_product` reference (most accurate)
  2. Lookup via `stock` + `product` combination
  3. Fallback to product's latest cost

**Benefits:**
- Accurate profit margin calculations based on actual StockProduct costs
- Supports different cost bases for the same product from different suppliers/batches
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing sales data

## Migration Path

### For Existing Data:
