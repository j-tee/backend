# Product Implementation Changes Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the major refactoring of the product and inventory system that shifted from product-centric pricing to stock-based pricing. The changes were implemented to provide more granular cost tracking, supplier-specific pricing, and better inventory management capabilities.

## Key Changes

### 1. Product Model Simplification

**Before:**
- Products contained `retail_price`, `wholesale_price`, and `cost` fields
- Pricing was static at the product level

**After:**
- Products are now "metadata only" for selling prices
- Removed `retail_price`, `wholesale_price`, and `cost` fields from Product model
- Products now focus on catalog information (name, SKU, category, unit, description)

### 2. Stock Model Refactoring

**Before:**
- Single `Stock` model represented individual stock items
- Each stock record was tied to a specific product with pricing

**After:**
- Split into two models:
  - `Stock`: Represents stock batches (containers for organizing inventory)
  - `StockProduct`: Represents individual stock line items with supplier-specific data

### 3. New Supplier Model

**Added:**
- `Supplier` model to track supplier information
- Fields: name, contact_person, email, phone_number, address, notes
- Stock products can now be linked to specific suppliers

### 4. Enhanced Cost Tracking

**New Cost Fields in StockProduct:**
- `unit_cost`: Base cost per unit
- `unit_tax_rate`: Tax rate percentage (0-100%)
- `unit_tax_amount`: Calculated or manually set tax amount
- `unit_additional_cost`: Additional costs (shipping, handling, etc.)

**Calculated Properties:**
- `landed_unit_cost`: Total cost per unit including all taxes and additional costs
- `total_base_cost`: Total base cost for all units
- `total_tax_amount`: Total tax for all units
- `total_additional_cost`: Total additional costs for all units
- `total_landed_cost`: Total landed cost for all units

### 5. Database Schema Changes

**Migration Consolidation:**
- Removed intermediate migrations that were no longer needed
- Consolidated schema changes into cleaner migration files
- Updated foreign key relationships to use new model structure

**New Tables:**
- `suppliers`: Supplier information
- `stock_batches`: Stock batch containers (renamed from `stock_batches`)
- `stock`: Individual stock items (renamed from `stock`)

**Updated Relationships:**
- `Inventory.stock` now references `StockProduct` instead of `Stock`
- `Transfer.stock` updated to reference `StockProduct`
- `SaleItem.stock` updated to reference `StockProduct`

### 6. API Changes

**New Endpoints:**
- `/inventory/api/stock-products/`: CRUD for individual stock items
- `/inventory/api/suppliers/`: CRUD for suppliers
- `/inventory/api/owner/workspace/`: Owner workspace overview

**Updated Serializers:**
- `ProductSerializer`: Removed pricing fields
- `StockSerializer`: Now represents stock batches with nested items
- `StockProductSerializer`: New serializer for individual stock items
- `SupplierSerializer`: New serializer for suppliers

**Enhanced Inventory Serializer:**
- Added `stock_arrival_date` and `stock_supplier` methods
- Updated to work with new stock structure

### 7. Business Logic Updates

**Cost Calculation:**
- Automatic tax amount calculation when `unit_tax_rate` is provided
- Comprehensive cost breakdown properties for analysis

**Stock Organization:**
- Stock batches group related stock items by arrival date and warehouse
- Better tracking of inventory receipts and organization

**Supplier Tracking:**
- Cost variations by supplier
- Supplier-specific stock tracking
- Enhanced reporting capabilities

### 8. Admin Interface Updates

**Product Admin:**
- Removed pricing fields from product admin
- Simplified to focus on catalog management

**Stock Admin:**
- Split into `StockAdmin` (batches) and `StockProductAdmin` (items)
- Enhanced fieldsets for cost management
- Better organization of cost-related fields

**New Supplier Admin:**
- Full CRUD for supplier management
- Search and filtering capabilities

### 9. Testing Updates

**Model Tests:**
- Updated to use new `StockProduct` model
- Tests for cost calculation logic
- Tests for supplier relationships

**API Tests:**
- New tests for owner workspace functionality
- Updated permission tests for business scoping
- Tests for storefront/warehouse creation restrictions

### 10. Reporting Updates

**Inventory Valuation:**
- Updated to work with new stock structure
- Enhanced cost calculation using landed costs
- Better supplier and batch tracking in reports

## Migration Path

### For Existing Data:
1. **Pricing Migration**: Existing product prices need to be migrated to stock items
2. **Stock Restructuring**: Existing stock records need to be split into batches and items
3. **Supplier Assignment**: Suppliers need to be created and assigned to stock items

### Code Updates Required:
1. **Frontend**: Update product forms to remove pricing fields
2. **Sales Logic**: Update to use stock-based pricing instead of product pricing
3. **Reports**: Update queries to use new stock structure
4. **Imports**: Update any data imports to work with new schema

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Granular Cost Tracking**: Track costs at the stock level with supplier variations
2. **Better Inventory Management**: Organize stock by batches and track arrivals
3. **Supplier Analytics**: Analyze cost variations by supplier
4. **Flexible Pricing**: Support different pricing strategies per stock batch
5. **Enhanced Reporting**: Better cost analysis and inventory valuation
6. **Scalability**: Support for complex inventory scenarios

## Breaking Changes

1. **API Contracts**: Product serializer no longer includes pricing fields
2. **Model Relationships**: Stock references changed from direct to batch+item structure
3. **Cost Access**: Product.cost field removed - use stock-based costs instead
4. **Stock Queries**: Need to traverse batch -> items for detailed stock information

## Future Considerations

1. **Pricing Strategies**: Implement configurable pricing rules per product/stock
2. **Cost Averaging**: Add logic for calculating average costs across suppliers
3. **Stock Optimization**: Add features for optimal stock level management
4. **Supplier Performance**: Track supplier reliability and cost trends
5. **Multi-currency**: Support for different currencies in cost tracking

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Model refactoring and migration creation ✅
- **Phase 2**: Serializer and API updates ✅
- **Phase 3**: Admin interface updates ✅
- **Phase 4**: Testing and validation ✅
- **Phase 5**: Frontend updates (pending)
- **Phase 6**: Data migration scripts (pending)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the changes can be rolled back by:
1. Reverting to previous migration state
2. Restoring product pricing fields
3. Reverting to single Stock model structure
4. Removing supplier-specific features

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**: Test cost calculation logic thoroughly
2. **Integration Tests**: Test full inventory workflows
3. **Performance Tests**: Monitor query performance with new structure
4. **Data Migration Tests**: Validate data integrity during migration
5. **API Compatibility Tests**: Ensure existing integrations still work

## Documentation Updates Needed

1. **API Documentation**: Update all inventory-related endpoints
2. **Frontend Integration Guide**: Update product and stock management sections
3. **User Manuals**: Update inventory management procedures
4. **Developer Guides**: Document new cost calculation logic
