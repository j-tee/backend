# Security Fix: One User One Business Enforcement

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Issue Description

### Security Breach Discovered
A critical security vulnerability was discovered where users could belong to multiple businesses simultaneously. This violated the fundamental business rule that **one email = one business**.

### Violations Found
1. **Julius Kudzo Tetteh (juliustetteh@gmail.com)**
   - DataLogique Systems (STAFF) ✓ LEGITIMATE
   - Test Electronics Store (OWNER) ❌ UNAUTHORIZED

2. **Mike Edit (mikedit009@gmail.com)**
   - Datalogique Ghana (OWNER) ✓ LEGITIMATE
   - Test Electronics Store (STAFF) ❌ UNAUTHORIZED

### Impact
- Users could access data from multiple businesses
- Cross-business data leakage possible
- Unauthorized access to sensitive business information
- Violation of data isolation principles

---

## Root Cause

The `BusinessMembership` model had a `unique_together` constraint on `['business', 'user']` which only prevented duplicate memberships **within the same business**. It did NOT prevent a user from joining **multiple different businesses**.

**Original Model (VULNERABLE):**
```python
class Meta:
    db_table = 'business_memberships'
    unique_together = ['business', 'user']  # Only prevents duplicates in SAME business
    ordering = ['business__name', 'user__name']
```

---

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Application-Level Validation
Added a `clean()` method to BusinessMembership that validates before saving:

```python
def clean(self):
    """Validate that user doesn't already belong to another business."""
    from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
    
    if self.user_id:
        existing = BusinessMembership.objects.filter(user=self.user).exclude(id=self.id)
        if existing.exists():
            existing_business = existing.first().business.name
            raise ValidationError(
                f"This user is already registered with {existing_business}. "
                f"A user can only belong to one business."
            )
```

### 2. Database-Level Constraint
Added a UNIQUE constraint on the `user` field:

```python
class Meta:
    db_table = 'business_memberships'
    unique_together = ['business', 'user']
    ordering = ['business__name', 'user__name']
    constraints = [
        models.UniqueConstraint(
            fields=['user'],
            name='one_user_one_business',
            violation_error_message='A user can only belong to one business. This email is already registered with another business.'
        )
    ]
```

### 3. Updated save() Method
Modified to call `clean()` before saving:

```python
def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
    # Validate before saving
    self.clean()
    
    if self.role == self.OWNER:
        self.is_admin = True
    
    # ... rest of save logic
    super().save(*args, **kwargs)
```

## Actions Taken

### 1. Data Cleanup
```
✅ Deleted unauthorized membership: Julius → Test Electronics Store (OWNER)
✅ Deleted unauthorized membership: Mike → Test Electronics Store (STAFF)
```

### 2. Migration Created
```
✅ Created migration: accounts/0011_one_user_one_business.py
✅ Fixed dependency issue in sales/0009_create_walk_in_customers.py
✅ Applied migration successfully
```

### 3. Testing
**Application-Level Test:**
```
✅ Attempting to add existing user to new business → BLOCKED
   Error: "This user is already registered with DataLogique Systems"
```

**Database-Level Test:**
```
✅ Attempting raw SQL insert for duplicate user → BLOCKED
   Error: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "one_user_one_business"
```

## Current State

### Verified Business Memberships
```
Total Memberships: 5
All Users: 1 Business Each ✓

User                           | Business                       | Role
------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------
(Anonymous)                    | Datalogique Ghana              | OWNER
Julius Kudzo Tetteh            | DataLogique Systems            | STAFF
Mike Edit                      | Datalogique Ghana              | OWNER
Mike Tetteh                    | DataLogique Systems            | OWNER
Test User                      | Test Business                  | OWNER
```

## Protection Layers

### Layer 1: Application Validation (clean() method)
- **When:** Before save()
- **Error:** User-friendly ValidationError
- **Bypass:** Not possible through Django ORM

### Layer 2: Database Constraint
- **When:** On INSERT/UPDATE
- **Error:** IntegrityError
- **Bypass:** Not possible even with raw SQL

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Backend API Tests
Add tests to verify:
- [ ] Creating user with existing email in different business → FAILS
- [ ] Inviting existing user to different business → FAILS
- [ ] Admin attempting to add user to second business → FAILS
- [ ] Business signup with existing email → FAILS

### Frontend Tests
Add UI validation:
- [ ] Email validation during signup checks if email exists
- [ ] Clear error message: "This email is already registered"
- [ ] Staff invitation checks if user already exists in another business

---

## Migration Details

**File:** `accounts/migrations/0011_one_user_one_business.py`

**SQL Generated:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE business_memberships 
ADD CONSTRAINT one_user_one_business 
UNIQUE (user_id);
```

**Rollback Plan:**
```bash
python manage.py migrate accounts 0010_link_membership_rbac_roles
```

---

## Future Improvements

### 1. Add to User Registration Flow
Update signup/invitation endpoints to:
- Check if email exists in ANY business
- Show clear error before attempting to create membership

### 2. Admin Dashboard Warning
Add warning in admin panel when viewing users:
- "⚠️ User can only belong to ONE business"

### 3. API Error Handling
Update API serializers to catch and format the validation error:
```python
{
  "error": "Email already registered",
  "detail": "This email is already registered with [Business Name]",
  "code": "USER_ALREADY_EXISTS"
}
```
