## Implemented Reports (4/4)

### 1. Stock Levels Summary Report ✅

**Endpoint:** `GET /reports/api/inventory/stock-levels/`

**Purpose:** Real-time overview of inventory across all warehouses with multi-dimensional breakdowns.

**Key Features:**
- Current stock quantities and values by product
- Warehouse-level aggregation
- Category-level aggregation
- Low stock and out-of-stock identification
- Multi-warehouse inventory comparison
- Supplier tracking
- Flexible filtering (warehouse, category, product, supplier, quantity ranges)
- Pagination support

**Query Parameters:**
- `warehouse_id`: UUID (filter by warehouse)
- `category_id`: UUID (filter by category)
- `product_id`: UUID (specific product)
- `supplier_id`: UUID (filter by supplier)
- `min_quantity`: int (products with at least this quantity)
- `max_quantity`: int (products with at most this quantity)
- `include_zero_stock`: boolean (default: false)
- `page`, `page_size`: pagination

**Data Sources:**
- StockProduct (quantity, landed_unit_cost)
- Product (name, SKU, category)
- Warehouse (name, location)
- Supplier (name)

**Key Calculations:**
- **Stock Value:** `quantity × landed_unit_cost`
- **Low Stock:** quantity < 10 (simplified threshold)
- **Out of Stock:** quantity = 0

**Example Summary:**
```json
{
  "total_products": 250,
  "total_stock_units": 15000,
  "total_stock_value": "750000.00",
  "warehouses_count": 3,
  "low_stock_products": 15,
  "out_of_stock_products": 5,
  "products_with_stock": 245
}
```

### 2. Low Stock Alerts Report ✅

**Endpoint:** `GET /reports/api/inventory/low-stock-alerts/`

**Purpose:** Identify products needing reorder with intelligent priority levels and sales velocity analysis.

**Key Features:**
- Products below stock thresholds
- Sales velocity calculation (30-day average)
- Days until stockout estimation

- `page`, `page_size`: pagination

**Priority Logic:**
- **Critical:** < 5 days of stock OR < 5 units remaining
- **High:** 5-14 days of stock remaining
- **Medium:** 15-30 days of stock remaining

**Calculations:**
- **Average Daily Sales:** Total sales last 30 days / 30
- **Days Until Stockout:** `current_quantity / average_daily_sales`
- **Recommended Order Quantity:** 40 days supply - current quantity (minimum 10 units)

**Data Sources:**
- StockProduct (current quantity, cost)
- SaleItem (sales history for velocity)
- Product, Warehouse, Supplier

**Example Alert:**
```json
{
  "product_name": "Product A",
  "current_quantity": 5,
  "priority": "critical",
  "days_until_stockout": 3.3,
  "average_daily_sales": 1.5,
