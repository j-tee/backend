# ✅ FIXED: Wholesale Toggle Reset Bug

**Issue**: WHOLESALE button clicked but immediately resets back to RETAIL  
**Date**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🐛 The Bug

### What Was Happening

**Console Logs Showed:**
```
🔄 Sale type toggle clicked: {current: "RETAIL", willChangeTo: "WHOLESALE", ...}
📊 Sale type changed to: WHOLESALE
📊 Sale type changed to: RETAIL  ← Immediate reset!
```

**The Flow:**
1. User clicks WHOLESALE button (currently showing RETAIL)
2. State changes to WHOLESALE ✅
3. Immediately resets back to RETAIL ❌
4. Button stays as "RETAIL"
5. Prices don't change

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

### The Bug Chain

**File**: `frontend/src/features/dashboard/pages/SalesPage.tsx`

**Line 475**: `setSaleType('RETAIL')` inside `prepareFreshSale()`
```typescript
const prepareFreshSale = useCallback(async (options) => {
  // ...
  setSaleType('RETAIL')  // ❌ This was resetting the user's choice
  // ...
}, [clearExistingCart, startFreshSaleSession])
```

**Line 528-542**: useEffect that calls `prepareFreshSale()`
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (activeTab !== 'new-sale') return
  if (!currentLocation) return
  if (currentCart || initializingSaleRef.current) return
  
  void prepareFreshSale()  // Called on various conditions
}, [activeTab, currentCart, currentLocation, prepareFreshSale])
```

**The Cycle:**
1. User toggles saleType → WHOLESALE
2. saleType change triggers re-render
3. Dependencies change
4. useEffect runs
5. Calls prepareFreshSale()
6. prepareFreshSale() resets saleType → RETAIL ❌

---

## ✅ The Fix

### What Was Changed

**Removed the problematic line from `prepareFreshSale()`**:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Buggy):
const prepareFreshSale = useCallback(async (options) => {
  if (initializingSaleRef.current) {
    return
  }

  initializingSaleRef.current = true

  setShowPayment(false)
  setSaleType('RETAIL')  // ❌ PROBLEM: Always resets to RETAIL
  setCustomerError(null)
  // ...
}, [clearExistingCart, startFreshSaleSession])
```

```typescript
// AFTER (Fixed):
const prepareFreshSale = useCallback(async (options) => {
  if (initializingSaleRef.current) {
    return
  }

  initializingSaleRef.current = true

  setShowPayment(false)
  // ✅ REMOVED: setSaleType('RETAIL')
  // Now preserves user's RETAIL/WHOLESALE preference
  setCustomerError(null)
  setEnsuringCustomer(false)
  setSelectedCustomer(null)
  setCheckoutCustomerId(null)

  try {
    await clearExistingCart()
    if (options?.startNewDraft) {
      await startFreshSaleSession()
    }
  } finally {
    initializingSaleRef.current = false
  }
}, [clearExistingCart, startFreshSaleSession])
```

### Why This Fix Works

**Before:**
- `prepareFreshSale()` always reset to RETAIL
- User couldn't maintain WHOLESALE preference
- Toggle appeared broken

**After:**
- `prepareFreshSale()` preserves current sale type
- User can switch and it stays
- Toggle works as expected ✅

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

### Test 1: Toggle to Wholesale

**Steps:**
1. Refresh page (F5)
2. Click WHOLESALE button (when showing RETAIL)
3. Watch console

**Expected Console:**
```
🔄 Sale type toggle clicked: {
  current: "RETAIL",
  willChangeTo: "WHOLESALE",
  hasCart: false
}
📊 Sale type changed to: WHOLESALE
```

**Expected UI:**
```
✅ Button changes to "📦 WHOLESALE"
✅ Button stays "WHOLESALE" (no reset)
✅ Prices update to wholesale
```

### Test 2: Search for Product

**Steps:**
1. Toggle to WHOLESALE
2. Search for "sugar"
3. Check price

**Expected:**
```
Sugar 1kg
Price: GH₵ 2.65 per unit  ← Wholesale price ✅
(Not GH₵ 3.12 retail price)
```

### Test 3: Toggle Back to Retail

**Steps:**
1. In WHOLESALE mode
2. Click WHOLESALE button again
3. Should toggle to RETAIL

**Expected:**
```
✅ Button changes to "🛒 RETAIL"

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Refresh Browser
```bash
Press F5 or Ctrl+R on Sales page
# Hot reload should work, but refresh to be sure
```

### Step 2: Open Console
```bash
F12 → Console tab
Clear old logs
```

### Step 3: Click WHOLESALE Button
```bash
Click once
Watch console logs
Watch button text change
```

### Step 4: Verify

**Console should show:**
```
🔄 Sale type toggle clicked: {current: "RETAIL", willChangeTo: "WHOLESALE", hasCart: false}
📊 Sale type changed to: WHOLESALE
```

**Should NOT show:**
```
📊 Sale type changed to: RETAIL  ← This should NOT appear anymore!
```

**Button should:**
```
✅ Show "📦 WHOLESALE"
✅ Stay "WHOLESALE" (not reset)
✅ Update styling to wholesale mode
```

### Step 5: Check Prices
```bash
1. Search for "sugar"
2. Check price display
3. Should show GH₵ 2.65 (wholesale)

## 🎯 Why This Bug Existed

### Original Design Intent

The `prepareFreshSale()` function was designed to:
- Clear the cart when starting fresh
- Reset all state for a new sale
- **Default to RETAIL** (most common sale type)

This made sense when called:
- After completing a sale
- After canceling a sale
- Explicitly starting a new transaction

### The Problem

But `prepareFreshSale()` was also called by useEffect:
- During normal component operation
- When dependencies changed
- While user was just browsing/toggling

This caused it to:
- Override user's toggle choice
- Reset preference unexpectedly
- Break the toggle UX

### The Solution

**Separate concerns**:
- Remove automatic RETAIL reset from `prepareFreshSale()`
- Let user control sale type via toggle
- Only reset sale type on explicit user actions (like completing sale)
- Preserve user preference during normal operation

---

## 🚀 Additional Benefits

### Side Effects of This Fix

1. **Better UX**: User preference persists across operations
2. **Less confusing**: Toggle behaves predictably
3. **Faster workflow**: Don't have to re-toggle every time
4. **Consistent state**: No unexpected resets

### What Stays the Same

1. **Cart clearing**: Still works correctly
2. **Customer reset**: Still resets customer selection
3. **Payment panel**: Still closes properly
4. **Sale completion**: Still completes normally
5. **Error handling**: Still catches errors

---

## 🔍 Technical Deep Dive

### React State Management Issue

**The Problem Pattern:**
```typescript
// State update from user action
setSaleType('WHOLESALE')

// useEffect runs due to dependency change
useEffect(() => {
  prepareFreshSale() // This function calls setSaleType('RETAIL')
}, [prepareFreshSale])

// Result: User's change is overridden
```

**Why useEffect Ran:**
- `prepareFreshSale` is in dependency array
- `prepareFreshSale` is a useCallback
- useCallback dependencies can change
- Triggers useEffect
- Calls prepareFreshSale
- Resets saleType

**The Fix:**
```typescript
// Remove setSaleType from prepareFreshSale
// User's state update is now preserved
setSaleType('WHOLESALE') // ✅ Stays WHOLESALE
```

### Alternative Solutions Considered

**Option 1: Remove prepareFreshSale from useEffect deps**
```typescript
// ❌ Bad: Would break linter rules and cause stale closures
useEffect(() => {
  prepareFreshSale()
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [activeTab, currentCart])
```

**Option 2: Add saleType to prepareFreshSale params**
```typescript
// ⚠️ Complex: More prop drilling, harder to maintain
prepareFreshSale({ preserveSaleType: true })
```

**Option 3: Remove setSaleType from prepareFreshSale** ✅
```typescript
// ✅ Simple, clean, solves the root cause
// prepareFreshSale no longer manages sale type
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### For Future Development

1. **Be careful with state resets in shared functions**
   - Functions called from multiple places shouldn't make assumptions about state
   - Prefer explicit state management over implicit resets

2. **useEffect dependency arrays**
   - Understand what triggers re-runs
   - Be mindful of callback dependencies
   - Test state changes thoroughly

3. **User preference preservation**
   - Don't override user choices unless explicitly intended
   - Reset state only when user explicitly requests it
   - Preserve preferences during normal operation

4. **Console logging is valuable**
   - The console logs helped identify the double state change
   - Keep useful debug logs during development
   - Remove or conditionally compile for production
