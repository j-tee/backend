## 🛡️ Data Integrity Protection Active

### API Validation (Already Implemented)
The `AddSaleItemSerializer` now validates **before** allowing sales:

1. ✅ **Checks storefront inventory exists** for the product
2. ✅ **Verifies sufficient quantity** available
3. ✅ **Returns clear error messages** if validation fails

### Error Messages Users Will See

**If product not in storefront:**
```json
{
  "product": [
    "Product 'Samsung TV 43\"' has not been transferred to storefront 'Adenta Store'. 
     Please create a transfer request and fulfill it first."
  ]
}
```

**If insufficient quantity:**
```json
{
  "quantity": [
    "Insufficient storefront inventory for 'Samsung TV 43\"'. 
     Available: 179, Requested: 200. 
     Create a transfer request to move more stock to this storefront."
  ]
}
```
