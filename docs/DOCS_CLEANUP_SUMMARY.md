## 📧 What to Tell Frontend Developer

**Send this:**

> Hey! For subscription implementation, read `SUBSCRIPTION_API_GUIDE.md` - it has everything you need in one place:
> - All API endpoints with examples
> - Authentication details (use `Token` not `Bearer`)
> - Complete flows for login, payment, etc.
> 
> Key points:
> 1. Login returns `token` (not `access_token`)
> 2. Fetch businesses separately: `GET /accounts/api/businesses/`
> 3. Use `Authorization: Token {token}` header
> 4. Subscription is business-centric, not user-centric
> 
> Let me know if you have questions!
