# Transfer Creation Issues - COMPLETELY FIXED

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### Problem 1: "Transfer matching query does not exist" (HTTP 500)

**Error:**
```
DoesNotExist: Transfer matching query does not exist
HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
```

**Root Cause:**
The issue was in **`inventory/transfer_models.py` line 191**:

```python
# Validate status transitions
if self.pk:  # ❌ WRONG for UUIDs
    old_status = Transfer.objects.get(pk=self.pk).status
```

The `Transfer` model uses `UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)`. Django assigns the UUID **immediately** when the instance is created, BEFORE saving to database. So `self.pk` exists even for new unsaved instances, causing the code to try fetching a non-existent record from the database.

**Fix:**
Changed to check if the record actually exists in the database:

```python
if self.pk and Transfer.objects.filter(pk=self.pk).exists():  # ✅ CORRECT
    old_status = Transfer.objects.get(pk=self.pk).status
```

### Problem 2: "This field cannot be blank" for transfer_type (HTTP 500)

**Error:**
```
ValidationError at /inventory/api/warehouse-transfers/
{'transfer_type': ['This field cannot be blank.']}
```

**Root Cause:**
The `transfer_type` field is required on the Transfer model, but the serializers weren't automatically setting it. Users shouldn't have to provide this - it should be inferred from which endpoint they're using:
- `/api/warehouse-transfers/` → `W2W` (warehouse-to-warehouse)
- `/api/storefront-transfers/` → `W2S` (warehouse-to-storefront)

**Fix:**
Added `create()` methods to both serializers to auto-set the transfer type:

**WarehouseTransferSerializer:**
```python
def create(self, validated_data):
    """Set transfer_type for warehouse-to-warehouse transfers"""
    from inventory.transfer_models import Transfer
    validated_data['transfer_type'] = Transfer.TYPE_WAREHOUSE_TO_WAREHOUSE
    return super().create(validated_data)
```

**StorefrontTransferSerializer:**
```python
def create(self, validated_data):
    """Set transfer_type for warehouse-to-storefront transfers"""
    from inventory.transfer_models import Transfer
    validated_data['transfer_type'] = Transfer.TYPE_WAREHOUSE_TO_STOREFRONT
    return super().create(validated_data)
```

### Problem 3: skip_validation parameter error

**Error:**
```
TypeError: TransferItem() got unexpected keyword arguments: 'skip_validation'
```

**Root Cause:**
The serializer was passing `skip_validation=True` to `TransferItem.objects.create()`, but this parameter is only accepted by the `.save()` method, not the model constructor.

**Fix:**
Changed from:
```python
TransferItem.objects.create(transfer=transfer, skip_validation=True, **item_data)
```

To:
```python
item = TransferItem(transfer=transfer, **item_data)
item.save(skip_validation=True)
```

## Files Modified

1. **`inventory/transfer_models.py`** (Line 191)
   - Added `.exists()` check before fetching old status during validation
   
2. **`inventory/transfer_serializers.py`** (Multiple locations)
   - Added `hasattr(request.user, 'primary_business')` check (line 210)
   - Added `create()` method to `WarehouseTransferSerializer` to set `transfer_type = W2W`
   - Added `create()` method to `StorefrontTransferSerializer` to set `transfer_type = W2S`
   - Fixed `skip_validation` to be passed to `.save()` not `.create()`

## Frontend Integration

The transfer creation now works perfectly with minimal payloads:

**Warehouse Transfer:**
```json
POST /inventory/api/warehouse-transfers/

{
  "source_warehouse": "uuid-here",
  "destination_warehouse": "uuid-here",
  "items": [
    {
      "product": "uuid-here",
      "quantity": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

**Storefront Transfer:**
```json
POST /inventory/api/storefront-transfers/

{
  "source_warehouse": "uuid-here",
  "destination_storefront": "uuid-here",
  "items": [
    {
      "product": "uuid-here",
      "quantity": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

All stock batch fields (unit_cost, supplier, expiry_date, tax fields, retail_price, wholesale_price) are automatically populated from the source warehouse's most recent stock record for that product.

## Status

✅ **COMPLETELY FIXED** - All three issues resolved
✅ System check passes
✅ Transfer creation tested successfully
✅ Auto-population working correctly
✅ Ready for production use
