# Sales Creation Error Fix - amount_refunded Field Issue

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Issue:** Unable to start a new sale - "amount_refunded: This field is required."  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 The Problem

### Error Message
```
Unable to start a new sale. Please try again.
```

### API Response (Developer Console)
```json
{
  "amount_refunded": ["This field is required."]
}
```

### Root Cause
The `SaleSerializer` was defining `amount_refunded` and `amount_paid` as **required fields** (via the DecimalField declaration) but they were **NOT** in the `read_only_fields` list.

When creating a new sale, these fields should be automatically set to `0.00` by the model defaults, not required from the frontend.

---

## ✅ The Fix

### File: `sales/serializers.py`

**Changed `read_only_fields` in `SaleSerializer.Meta`:**

```python
# BEFORE (Line 303-307)
read_only_fields = [
    'id', 'receipt_number', 'subtotal', 'total_amount', 'amount_due',
    'created_at', 'updated_at', 'completed_at'
]

# AFTER (Fixed)
read_only_fields = [
    'id', 'receipt_number', 'subtotal', 'total_amount', 'amount_due',
    'amount_paid', 'amount_refunded',  # ✅ Added - System-managed fields
    'created_at', 'updated_at', 'completed_at'
]
```

### Why This Fix Works

1. **`amount_paid`** - Calculated when payments are recorded
   - Model default: `Decimal('0.00')`
   - Should NOT be set by user on sale creation
   - Updated automatically via `Payment` records

2. **`amount_refunded`** - Calculated when refunds are issued
   - Model default: `Decimal('0.00')`
   - Should NOT be set by user on sale creation
   - Updated automatically via refund operations

Both fields are **system-managed** and should be read-only in the API.

## 🔍 How the Model Handles These Fields

### From `sales/models.py` (Lines 407-419)

```python
amount_paid = models.DecimalField(
    max_digits=12,
    decimal_places=2,
    default=Decimal('0.00'),  # ✅ Auto-set on creation
    validators=[MinValueValidator(Decimal('0.00'))],
    help_text="Total amount already paid"
)
amount_refunded = models.DecimalField(
    max_digits=12,
    decimal_places=2,
    default=Decimal('0.00'),  # ✅ Auto-set on creation
    validators=[MinValueValidator(Decimal('0.00'))],
    help_text="Total amount refunded to the customer"
)
```

**Key Point:** Both fields have `default=Decimal('0.00')`, meaning:
- New sales automatically get `amount_paid = 0.00`
- New sales automatically get `amount_refunded = 0.00`
- Frontend doesn't need to send these values
- Serializer should mark them as read-only

## ✅ Verification

### Django Check
```bash
python manage.py check
# Result: System check identified no issues (0 silenced) ✅
```

### Expected Behavior Now

**Creating a Sale (POST /sales/api/sales/):**

Frontend sends:
```json
{
  "storefront": "26a61219-33f8-4a2a-b3dd-f3fd0b5f17ee",
  "customer": "walk-in-customer-id",
  "type": "RETAIL",
  "payment_type": "CASH"
}
```

Backend responds with:
```json
{
  "id": "new-sale-id",
  "storefront": "26a61219-33f8-4a2a-b3dd-f3fd0b5f17ee",
  "customer": "walk-in-customer-id",
  "receipt_number": "REC-202510-001",
  "type": "RETAIL",
  "status": "DRAFT",
  "payment_type": "CASH",
  "subtotal": "0.00",
  "discount_amount": "0.00",
  "tax_amount": "0.00",
  "total_amount": "0.00",
  "amount_paid": "0.00",      // ✅ Auto-set by model
  "amount_refunded": "0.00",  // ✅ Auto-set by model
  "amount_due": "0.00",
  ...
}
```

**No validation errors!** ✅

## 🎯 Related Fields (Also System-Managed)

The following fields are correctly marked as read-only:

1. **`id`** - UUID, auto-generated
2. **`receipt_number`** - Auto-generated on creation
3. **`subtotal`** - Calculated from sale items
4. **`total_amount`** - Calculated: subtotal - discount + tax
5. **`amount_due`** - Calculated: total_amount - amount_paid + amount_refunded
6. **`amount_paid`** - ✅ NOW read-only (calculated from payments)
7. **`amount_refunded`** - ✅ NOW read-only (calculated from refunds)
8. **`created_at`** - Auto timestamp
9. **`updated_at`** - Auto timestamp
10. **`completed_at`** - Set when status changes to COMPLETED
