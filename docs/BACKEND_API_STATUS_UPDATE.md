## ‚úÖ SALES HISTORY API - IMPLEMENTED!

### Quick Summary

The Sales History API that was reported as "MISSING" has actually been **fully implemented and enhanced** to meet all frontend requirements.

### What Was Found

1. **Existing Implementation** ‚úÖ
   - Sale model with all required fields
   - SaleItem model (related as `sale_items`)
   - Payment model (related as `payments`)
   - Basic ViewSet with filters
   - Pagination already configured (20 items/page)
   - 504 sales in database (375 completed)

2. **What Was Added** üîß
   - `line_items` field (alias for `sale_items` to match frontend expectations)
   - `payments` nested serializer in Sale response
   - Enhanced `user_name` field with proper name retrieval
   - Date range filters (`date_from`, `date_to`)
   - Search functionality (receipt number, customer name, product name/SKU)
   - Additional filters (user, type, payment_type)
   - Performance optimizations (`prefetch_related` for payments and nested items)
   - Enhanced field mappings:
     * `product_category` in line items
     * `subtotal` in line items
     * `cost_price` from stock_product
     * `transaction_reference`, `phone_number`, `card_last_4`, `card_brand` in payments
     * `processed_at`, `failed_at`, `error_message` in payments

### API Endpoint

```
GET /sales/api/sales/
```

**Available Filters:**
- `page`, `page_size` - Pagination
- `status` - Filter by status (COMPLETED, DRAFT, etc.)
- `storefront` - Filter by storefront UUID
- `customer` - Filter by customer UUID
- `user` - Filter by cashier/user UUID
- `type` - Filter by sale type (RETAIL, WHOLESALE)
- `payment_type` - Filter by payment method
- `date_from`, `date_to` - Date range filtering
- `search` - Text search (receipt, customer, product)

## üîç Other Issues Status

### 1. SAMPLE Adjustment Approval Bug
**Status:** ‚è≥ **PENDING FIX**

**Issue:** SAMPLE adjustments in database have `requires_approval = false`

**Fix Required:**
```sql
-- Run this SQL to fix existing data
UPDATE inventory_stockadjustment 
SET requires_approval = true 
WHERE adjustment_type = 'SAMPLE' AND requires_approval = false;
```

**OR**

Create a Django migration:
```python
# Create migration file
python manage.py makemigrations inventory --empty

# Add this in the migration:
from django.db import migrations

def fix_sample_approval(apps, schema_editor):
    StockAdjustment = apps.get_model('inventory', 'StockAdjustment')
    StockAdjustment.objects.filter(
        adjustment_type='SAMPLE',
        requires_approval=False
    ).update(requires_approval=True)

class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    dependencies = [
        ('inventory', '<previous_migration>'),
    ]
    
    operations = [
        migrations.RunPython(fix_sample_approval),
    ]
```

**Time Estimate:** 10 minutes
