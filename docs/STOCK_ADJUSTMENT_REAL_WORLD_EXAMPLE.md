├─ 📥 STOCK INTAKE (Physical Count)
│  └─ Received: 40 items
│  
├─ ❌ DATA ENTRY ERROR

## The Problem We Solved

### Before `quantity_before` Feature

**What Frontend Saw:**
```json
{
  "stock_product_details": {
    "product_name": "10mm Armoured Cable 50m",
    "current_quantity": 44
  },
  "quantity": -4
}
```

**User Confusion:**
- ❓ "Is 44 the original intake amount?"
  - **Answer:** No, 40 was the actual intake. 44 was entered by mistake.
- ❓ "Or did stock change since the adjustment was created?"
  - **Answer:** No, it's been 44 since Oct 1 (creation date).
- ❓ "What will the final stock be after approval?"
  - **Answer:** 40 items (the correct intake amount).
- ❓ "Does this make sense given our intake of 40?"
  - **Answer:** Yes! The adjustment corrects the data entry error.

**User couldn't connect the dots:**
- Intake: 40 items (physical count)
- Showing: 44 items (system)
- Adjustment: -4 items
- **Missing link:** Stock was CREATED with 44 instead of 40 on Oct 1 (likely frontend entry error)

## The Math

### Stock Level Journey

```
Oct 1, 2025 - 18:22:58 (Stock Creation)
    │
    ├─ Physical Intake: 40 items
    ├─ System Entry: 44 items ← DATA ENTRY ERROR (+4)
    │
    ↓
Oct 1-6, 2025 (Stock Unchanged)
    │
    ├─ Stock remains: 44 items
    ├─ No sales, no adjustments
    │
    ↓
Oct 6, 2025 - 10:16 AM (Error Discovered)
    │
    ├─ Adjustment Created
    ├─ quantity_before: 44  ← CAPTURED
    ├─ quantity: -4
    ├─ Reason: Correcting data entry error
    │
    ↓
Current State (real-time)
    │
    ├─ current_quantity: 44 (still incorrect)
    │
    ↓
After Approval (predicted)
    │
    └─ Final: 44 + (-4) = 40 ✅ (Corrected!)
```

### Why This Matters

**Scenario 1: Stock Unchanged (Current Case)**
```
quantity_at_creation: 44
current_quantity: 44
Difference: 0

Status: ✅ Safe to approve
Reason: Stock stable, no sales/changes since creation
```

**Scenario 2: Stock Changed (Hypothetical)**
```
quantity_at_creation: 44
current_quantity: 38 (6 sold)
Difference: -6

Status: ⚠️ Review needed
Reason: Stock decreased since creation
After approval: 38 + (-4) = 34
Question: Is adjusting down by 4 still correct given the 6 already sold?
```

**Scenario 3: Stock Increased (Hypothetical)**
```
quantity_at_creation: 44
current_quantity: 50 (6 received)
Difference: +6

Status: ⚠️ Review needed
Reason: More stock came in
After approval: 50 + (-4) = 46
Question: Should we still mark 4 as damaged, or were the damaged ones replaced?
```

## Technical Implementation

### How It Works

**1. Adjustment Creation:**
```python
# When user creates adjustment
adjustment = StockAdjustment.objects.create(
    stock_product=stock_product,
    adjustment_type='DAMAGE',
    quantity=-4,
    # ... other fields
)

# Model's save() method automatically captures:
if not self.pk:  # New object
    self.quantity_before = self.stock_product.quantity  # 44
```

**2. API Serialization:**
```python
def get_stock_product_details(self, obj):
    return {
        'quantity_at_creation': obj.quantity_before,  # 44 (frozen)
        'current_quantity': obj.stock_product.quantity,  # 44 (live)
        # ... other fields
    }
```

**3. Frontend Calculation:**
```typescript
const afterApproval = currentQuantity + adjustmentQuantity
// 44 + (-4) = 40
```

```typescript
interface AdjustmentDetails {
  stock_product_details: {
    quantity_at_creation: number | null
    current_quantity: number
  }
  quantity: number
}

function calculateImpact(adjustment: AdjustmentDetails) {
  const { quantity_at_creation, current_quantity } = adjustment.stock_product_details
  const quantityChange = adjustment.quantity
  
  // Stock changed since creation?
  const hasChanged = quantity_at_creation !== current_quantity
  const changeAmount = current_quantity - (quantity_at_creation || 0)
  
  // Predicted outcome
  const afterApproval = current_quantity + quantityChange
  
  return {
    hasChanged,
    changeAmount,
    afterApproval,
    isStockStable: !hasChanged,
    warning: hasChanged ? `Stock changed by ${changeAmount} since creation` : null
  }
}

// Usage
const impact = calculateImpact(adjustment)

if (impact.isStockStable) {
  showMessage('✅ Stock unchanged - safe to approve')
} else {
  showWarning(`⚠️ ${impact.warning}`)
}
```

```
✅ Database Field: quantity_before exists
✅ Auto-Capture: Working on creation
✅ API Response: Returns both values
✅ Migration: Applied successfully
✅ Backfill: Existing data updated
✅ Testing: All tests pass
```

### Live Data Verification

```bash
# Query the actual adjustment
Stock Product: 10mm Armoured Cable 50m (ELEC-0007)
Current Quantity: 44 items

Adjustment ID: 1e0c4f43-...
Type: DAMAGE
Quantity: -4
quantity_before: 44 ✅
Status: PENDING

API Response:
{
  "quantity_at_creation": 44 ✅
  "current_quantity": 44 ✅
}

Calculation:
  After approval = 44 + (-4) = 40 ✅
  Matches intake level: 40 ✅
```
