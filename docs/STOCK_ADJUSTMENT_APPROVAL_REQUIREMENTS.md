# ✅ Stock Adjustment System: Approval & Completion Requirements

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **CONFIGURED**

---

## Configuration Summary

### All Adjustments Require Approval ✅

**Requirement:** Every stock adjustment must be approved before it affects inventory.

**Implementation:**
```python
# File: inventory/adjustment_serializers.py

def validate(self, data):
    # ALL adjustments require approval for proper oversight
    # This ensures every stock change is reviewed before being applied
    data['requires_approval'] = True
    
    return data
```

**Result:**
- ✅ All new adjustments created with `requires_approval = True`
- ✅ No auto-approval for any adjustment type
- ✅ All adjustments start with `status = PENDING`

---

### Approval Immediately Completes ✅

**Requirement:** Once approval is granted, the adjustment should be completed immediately.

**Implementation:**
```python
# File: inventory/adjustment_views.py

@action(detail=True, methods=['post'])
def approve(self, request, pk=None):
    """
    Approve a pending adjustment and immediately apply it to stock.
    """
    adjustment = self.get_object()
    
    # Approve the adjustment
    adjustment.approve(request.user)
    
    # Immediately complete it to apply stock changes
    adjustment.complete()
    
    return Response(serializer.data)
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Single-click approval applies the adjustment
- ✅ Stock levels update immediately
- ✅ Status goes from PENDING → APPROVED → COMPLETED in one action

---

## Complete Workflow

### 1. Creation

```
User creates adjustment:
  ├─ Status: PENDING
  ├─ requires_approval: True (always)
  ├─ Stock: Unchanged
  └─ Awaits manager approval
```

### 2. Approval

```
Manager clicks "Approve":
  ├─ Status: APPROVED (intermediate state)
  ├─ Approved by: {manager}
  ├─ Approved at: {timestamp}
  ├─ Then immediately:
  │   ├─ Status: COMPLETED
  │   ├─ Stock: Updated
  │   └─ Completed at: {timestamp}
  └─ Result: Stock levels reflect the adjustment
```

### 3. Rejection (Alternative)

```
Manager clicks "Reject":
  ├─ Status: REJECTED
  ├─ Stock: Unchanged
  └─ Adjustment cancelled
```

---

## Status Flow

```
┌─────────┐
│ PENDING │ ← All adjustments start here
└────┬────┘
     │
     ├─── Approve ──→ ┌──────────┐    Auto     ┌───────────┐
     │                │ APPROVED │ ─────────→  │ COMPLETED │
     │                └──────────┘   Complete  └───────────┘
     │                                          Stock Updated ✅
     │
     └─── Reject ──→  ┌──────────┐
                      │ REJECTED │
                      └──────────┘
                      Stock Unchanged ❌
```

### Creating Adjustments

```typescript
// Create adjustment
const response = await api.post('/stock-adjustments/', {
  stock_product: productId,
  adjustment_type: 'DAMAGE',
  quantity: -5,
  reason: 'Items damaged during handling',
  unit_cost: '10.00'
})

// Result: status = PENDING, requires_approval = true
```

### Approving Adjustments

```typescript
// Single call to approve (auto-completes)
await api.post(`/stock-adjustments/${id}/approve/`)

// Result: 
// - status = COMPLETED
// - stock updated immediately
// - No need to call /complete/ separately
```

### UI Display

<AdjustmentCard adjustment={adjustment}>
  {adjustment.status === 'PENDING' && (
    <div>
      <Badge>Requires Approval</Badge>
      <Button onClick={approveAdjustment}>
        Approve & Apply
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={rejectAdjustment}>
        Reject
      </Button>
    </div>
  )}
  
  {adjustment.status === 'COMPLETED' && (
    <div>
      <Badge variant="success">Applied</Badge>
