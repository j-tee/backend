## Data Generation Strategy

### 1. Temporal Consistency ✅

**Critical Rule:** All data respects chronological order

```
Stock Intake Date
    ↓
Stock Adjustment Date (AFTER intake)
    ↓
Sales Date (AFTER stock available)
    ↓
Payment Date (AFTER or SAME as sale date)
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ Stock intake: Jan 10, 2025 → Damage adjustment: Jan 15, 2025 → Sale: Jan 20, 2025
- ❌ Stock intake: Jan 20, 2025 → Sale: Jan 15, 2025 (IMPOSSIBLE - prevented)

## Data Integrity Validation

### ✅ Temporal Consistency

All records respect chronological order:
- Stock adjustments happen AFTER stock intake
- Sales happen AFTER stock is available
- Payments happen ON or AFTER sale date
- Credit payments respect credit terms (mostly)

### ✅ Stock Levels

Stock quantities properly tracked:
- Intake adds to inventory
- Sales reduce inventory
- Adjustments modify inventory
- No negative stock (validation enforced)

### ✅ Financial Accuracy

- Sales totals = subtotal + tax - discount
- Payment amounts ≤ sale total
- Customer balances = pending + partial amounts
- All currency values use Decimal (2 places)

### ✅ Business Logic

- Walk-in customers: No credit allowed
- Credit sales: Within customer credit limit
- Wholesale vs Retail: Appropriate pricing
- Receipt numbers: Unique (sequential)

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Stock Availability Queries

```sql
-- Check current stock levels
SELECT 
    p.name, 
    SUM(sp.quantity) as total_quantity,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sp.id) as batch_count
FROM products p
JOIN stock_products sp ON p.id = sp.product_id
GROUP BY p.id, p.name
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;
```

### 2. Outstanding Credit

```sql
-- Customers with balances
SELECT 
    name, 
    outstanding_balance, 
    credit_limit,
    credit_limit - outstanding_balance as available_credit
FROM customers
WHERE outstanding_balance > 0
ORDER BY outstanding_balance DESC;
```

### 3. Monthly Revenue

```sql
-- Revenue by month
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
    COUNT(*) as sales_count,
    SUM(amount_paid) as revenue
FROM sales
WHERE status IN ('COMPLETED', 'PARTIAL')
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at)
ORDER BY month;
```

### 4. Adjustment Impact

```sql
-- Stock adjustments by type
SELECT 
    adjustment_type,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(ABS(quantity)) as total_units,
    SUM(unit_cost * ABS(quantity)) as total_value
FROM stock_adjustments
WHERE status = 'COMPLETED'
GROUP BY adjustment_type
ORDER BY total_value DESC;
```

... ).order_by('-total')
```

**Verify Sales:**
```python
>>> from sales.models import Sale
>>> Sale.objects.filter(status='COMPLETED').count()
374  # Should match summary
```

**Check Payments:**
```python
>>> from sales.models import Payment
>>> Payment.objects.count()
395  # Should match summary
```
