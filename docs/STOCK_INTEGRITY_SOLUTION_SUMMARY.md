# Summary: Stock Adjustment Integrity - Preserving Single Source of Truth

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Issue:** Critical data integrity problem identified and RESOLVED  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Solution revised to preserve architectural integrity

---

## üéØ What Changed

### Original Approach (WRONG ‚ùå)
Auto-modify `stock_product.quantity` when adjustments approved:
```sql
-- This was WRONG - breaks single source of truth!
UPDATE stock_products 
SET quantity = quantity + adjustment.quantity
WHERE id = adjustment.stock_product_id;
```

**Problem:** Corrupts the baseline data, cascading data integrity issues

### Revised Approach (CORRECT ‚úÖ)
Calculate available quantity dynamically WITHOUT modifying recorded:
```sql
-- This is CORRECT - preserves single source of truth!
available_quantity = stock_product.quantity + SUM(approved_adjustments.quantity)
```

**Benefits:** Preserves architectural integrity, maintains data accuracy

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Principle

### Single Source of Truth: `stock_product.quantity`

This field represents the **recorded batch size** - the quantity initially received from the supplier.

**MUST:**
- ‚úÖ Be set when stock is received
- ‚úÖ Only change via explicit user action (CRUD edit)
- ‚úÖ Be updated via physical count corrections (user-initiated)
- ‚úÖ Serve as the immutable baseline for all calculations

**MUST NOT:**
- ‚ùå Be modified by adjustments automatically
- ‚ùå Be changed by triggers or background processes
- ‚ùå Be used to store calculated or derived values

---

## üìä How It Works

### Data Storage
```
stock_products table:
  id: uuid
  quantity: 100  ‚Üê NEVER modified automatically

stock_adjustments table:
  id: uuid
  stock_product_id: uuid (FK)
  quantity: -10  ‚Üê Stored separately
  status: 'APPROVED'
```

### Availability Calculation (Dynamic)
```python
# At read time, calculate:
available = stock_product.quantity + SUM(
    adjustment.quantity 
    WHERE status IN ('APPROVED', 'COMPLETED')
)

# Example:
# Recorded: 100
# Damage: -10 (APPROVED)
# Found: +5 (APPROVED)
# Available: 100 + (-10) + 5 = 95
```

### Enforcement (Database Triggers)
```sql
-- Trigger checks calculated available, NOT stored quantity
IF requested_quantity > (recorded_qty + SUM(adjustments)) THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Insufficient stock available';
END IF;
```

## üìÅ Files Updated

### Documentation (3 files)
1. **`docs/CRITICAL_STOCK_ADJUSTMENT_INTEGRITY_REVISED.md`**
   - Complete implementation guide (50+ pages)
   - Explains single source of truth principle
   - Provides migration plan and code examples

2. **`docs/STOCK_INTEGRITY_QUICK_REF.md`** (REVISED)
   - Quick reference guide
   - Before/after comparison
   - Testing checklist

3. **`docs/STOCK_ADJUSTMENT_EDIT_SUMMARY.md`** (UPDATED)
   - Added critical update notice
   - Warned frontend about changes

### SQL Triggers (REVISED - 3 files)
1. **`inventory/sql/triggers/audit_adjustment_approval.sql`** (REVISED)
   - Changed from `auto_apply_approved_adjustment`
   - Now AUDITS approvals, does NOT modify quantity
   - Preserves single source of truth

2. **`inventory/sql/triggers/check_stock_availability.sql`** (REVISED)
   - Updated to use CALCULATED availability
   - Formula: recorded + SUM(adjustments)
   - Added clear comments explaining approach

3. **`inventory/sql/triggers/check_adjustment_validity.sql`** (UNCHANGED)
   - Already used calculated approach
   - Validates using dynamic availability

4. **`inventory/sql/triggers/create_audit_log.sql`** (UNCHANGED)
   - Audit infrastructure
   - No changes needed

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

| Aspect | Before (Wrong) | After (Correct) |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Quantity Field** | Modified by trigger | Never modified automatically |
| **Adjustments** | Applied to quantity | Stored separately, summed for calculation |
| **Available Calc** | Direct field value | Dynamic: recorded + SUM(adjustments) |
| **Single Source** | Violated | Preserved ‚úì |
| **Data Integrity** | Compromised | Maintained ‚úì |
| **Architecture** | Broken | Clean ‚úì |

## üí° Key Insights

### Why This Matters

1. **Stock Stats Dependency**
   - All stock calculations use `quantity` as baseline
   - Modifying it mid-stream corrupts dependent calculations
   - Creates cascading data integrity issues

2. **Reconciliation Accuracy**
   - Reconciliation compares recorded vs. actual
   - If recorded changes automatically, reconciliation becomes meaningless
   - Must preserve original baseline for accurate comparison

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Need clear history: what was received vs. what happened to it
   - Modifying quantity erases the original truth
   - Adjustments stored separately provide complete audit trail

4. **Physical Count Corrections**
   - When physical count differs from system
   - User must explicitly update quantity (with audit log)
   - This is the ONLY time quantity should change

## üöÄ Implementation Path Forward

### Phase 1: Database Triggers
- ‚úÖ SQL files already revised and ready
- ‚úÖ Audit trigger (not mutation trigger)
- ‚úÖ Availability checks using calculation
- ‚è≥ Create Django migration

### Phase 2: Django Models
```python
class StockProduct(models.Model):
    quantity = models.PositiveIntegerField()  # Single source of truth
    
    @property
    def available_quantity(self) -> int:
        """Calculate - never mutate"""
        adjustments = self.stock_adjustments.filter(
            status__in=['APPROVED', 'COMPLETED']
        ).aggregate(Sum('quantity'))['total'] or 0
        return self.quantity + adjustments
```

### Phase 3: Views & Serializers
- Use `available_quantity` property for checks
- Display both `recorded` and `available` to frontend
- Clear error messages explaining both values

### Phase 4: Frontend Updates
- Show both recorded and available quantities
- Explain difference in UI
- Handle new error message format

---

## üéì Lessons Learned

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern: Mutating Source Data
```python
# DON'T DO THIS
stock.quantity += adjustment.quantity  # Corrupts baseline!
```

### ‚úÖ Best Practice: Calculate from Source
```python
# DO THIS
available = stock.quantity + sum(adjustments)  # Preserves baseline!
```
