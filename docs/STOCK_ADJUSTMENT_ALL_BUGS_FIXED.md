# ✅ Stock Adjustment System - All Bugs Fixed

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** 🎉 **PRODUCTION READY**  

---

## Summary

The stock adjustment system had **3 critical bugs** that blocked frontend integration. All have been **identified, fixed, tested, and documented**.

---

## Bug #1: Business Relationship Path ✅ FIXED

**Error:** `AttributeError: 'Warehouse' object has no attribute 'business'`

**Affected:** `POST /inventory/api/stock-adjustments/` (Creation)

**Root Cause:** Code tried to access `warehouse.business` but Warehouse doesn't have a direct business field

**Solution:** Changed to `product.business` in 4 locations:
- `stock_adjustments.py` line 172
- `adjustment_serializers.py` lines 142, 352, 356

**Documentation:** `docs/BUG_FIX_STOCK_ADJUSTMENT_BUSINESS.md`

---

## Bug #2: Product Code & User Name ✅ FIXED

**Errors:**
- `AttributeError: 'Product' object has no attribute 'code'`
- `AttributeError: 'User' object has no attribute 'get_full_name'`

**Affected:** `GET /inventory/api/stock-adjustments/` (Listing)

**Root Causes:**
- Product model uses `sku` field, not `code`
- User model has `name` field, not `get_full_name()` method

**Solutions:**
- Changed `product.code` → `product.sku` in 3 locations
- Changed `user.get_full_name()` → `user.name` in 4 locations

**Documentation:** `docs/BUG_FIX_PRODUCT_CODE_USER_NAME.md`

---

## Bug #3: Approval Logic ✅ FIXED (NEW)

**Error:** Frontend approval buttons not appearing

**Affected:** Approval UI for DAMAGE, SPOILAGE, EXPIRED adjustments

**Root Cause:** These adjustment types were not in the `sensitive_types` list, so `requires_approval` was `false`

**Solution:** 
- Added DAMAGE, SPOILAGE, EXPIRED to sensitive_types list
- Updated 1 existing DAMAGE adjustment in database

**Documentation:** `docs/BUG_FIX_APPROVAL_LOGIC.md`

## Frontend Integration Guide

### 1. Create Stock Adjustment

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/inventory/api/stock-adjustments/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Token ${userToken}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    stock_product: productId,        // UUID of stock product
    adjustment_type: 'DAMAGE',       // See 16 types in docs
    quantity: 3,                     // Will be auto-corrected to -3
    reason: 'Boxes damaged',         // Required
    unit_cost: '12.00'              // Optional, uses product cost if not provided
  })
});

// Auto-set fields (don't send):
// - business: from user's membership ✅
// - created_by: from request.user ✅
// - status: auto-determined (PENDING or APPROVED) ✅
// - requires_approval: auto-determined by type ✅ FIXED!
```

### 2. List Stock Adjustments

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/inventory/api/stock-adjustments/', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Token ${userToken}`
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
// Returns:
{
  "count": 25,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "stock_product_details": {
        "product_code": "ELEC-0007",     // ✅ SKU (Bug #2 fixed)
        "product_name": "Cable 50m",      // ✅ Product name
        "current_quantity": 15
      },
      "created_by_name": "Mike Tetteh",  // ✅ User name (Bug #2 fixed)
      "adjustment_type": "DAMAGE",
      "adjustment_type_display": "Damage/Breakage",
      "quantity": -4,
      "status": "PENDING",
      "requires_approval": true,         // ✅ Now TRUE! (Bug #3 fixed)
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Approval Buttons Logic (Now Works!)

```typescript
// This now correctly shows buttons for DAMAGE adjustments!
const canApprove = adjustment?.status === 'PENDING' && adjustment?.requires_approval
// = "PENDING" === 'PENDING' && true
// = true && true
// = true ✅ Buttons show!
```

### 4. Approve Adjustment

```javascript
const response = await fetch(`/inventory/api/stock-adjustments/${id}/approve/`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Token ${userToken}`
  }
});
```
