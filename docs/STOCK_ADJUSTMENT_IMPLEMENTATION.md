# Stock Adjustment System - Implementation Summary

**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… **COMPLETE - PRODUCTION READY**  
**System Check:** 0 errors  

---

## Problem Statement

The original inventory system tracked stock with a simple `quantity` field on `StockProduct`, which didn't account for real-world inventory changes such as:

- Theft/shrinkage
- Damage and breakage
- Product expiration and spoilage  
- Customer returns
- Physical count discrepancies
- Supplier returns
- Lost or found items
- Inventory corrections

**Impact:** Stock levels didn't reflect reality, leading to:
- Inaccurate inventory counts
- No accountability for losses
- No audit trail for changes
- No financial impact tracking
- Difficulty with compliance and reporting

---

## Solution Implemented

Comprehensive **Stock Adjustment System** with:

### 1. Complete Audit Trail
- Every adjustment tracked with who, when, why
- Supporting documentation (photos, documents)
- Approval workflow for sensitive adjustments
- Link to related transactions (sales, transfers)

### 2. Financial Impact Tracking
- Unit cost at time of adjustment
- Total cost calculation
- Shrinkage analysis by type
- Financial reporting capabilities

### 3. Physical Count Reconciliation
- Create count sessions
- Record system vs actual quantities
- Auto-generate adjustments for discrepancies
- Variance analysis and reporting

### 4. Multi-Tenant Security
- Business scoping via BusinessMembership
- Permission-based access
- Cannot access other businesses' data

15. **RECOUNT** - Physical count adjustment
16. **OTHER** - Other reasons

---

## Approval Logic

### Always Require Approval:
- `THEFT` adjustments (security)
- `LOSS` adjustments (security)
- `WRITE_OFF` adjustments (financial)
- Any adjustment over $1000 (financial threshold)

### Auto-Approved:
- `CUSTOMER_RETURN` (low risk)
- `TRANSFER_IN` (system-generated)
- `TRANSFER_OUT` (system-generated)
- Low-value adjustments of other types

### Status Flow:
```
CREATE
  â†“
PENDING (if requires approval)
  â†“ approve()
APPROVED
  â†“ complete()
COMPLETED (stock updated)
```

OR

```
CREATE
  â†“
APPROVED (auto-approved types)
  â†“ complete() (auto-called)
COMPLETED
```

---

## Business Logic

### Auto-Corrections
1. **Quantity Sign**: Adjustment type determines if quantity should be positive or negative. API auto-corrects if wrong sign provided.
   - THEFT with `quantity: 5` â†’ corrected to `-5`
   - CUSTOMER_RETURN with `quantity: -2` â†’ corrected to `2`

2. **Unit Cost**: Defaults to `stock_product.landed_unit_cost` if not provided.

3. **Total Cost**: Always calculated as `abs(unit_cost * abs(quantity))`.

4. **Business Assignment**: Auto-set from user's active BusinessMembership.

5. **Created By**: Auto-set to current request user.

### Validations
1. **Quantity cannot be zero**
2. **Stock cannot go negative**: Adjustment that would result in `stock_product.quantity < 0` is rejected
3. **Stock product must belong to user's business**
4. **Approval status**: Can only approve PENDING, reject PENDING, complete APPROVED

### Security
1. **Business Scoping**: All queries filtered by user's active business
2. **Multi-Tenant**: Cannot see/modify other businesses' adjustments
3. **Audit Trail**: All actions tracked with user and timestamp
