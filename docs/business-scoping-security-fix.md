# Business Scoping Security Implementation

## Overview

This document details the critical security enhancement implemented to address a multi-tenant data isolation vulnerability in the POS backend system. The vulnerability allowed potential data leakage between different business owners, posing a serious security risk to the SaaS platform.

## Security Vulnerability Description

### Problem Identified
The Product, Stock, and Supplier models were not properly scoped to individual businesses in the multi-tenant SaaS architecture. This meant that:

- Users from different businesses could potentially access each other's product and supplier data
- No business-level isolation existed for inventory-related entities
- Data leakage was possible through API endpoints that didn't enforce business ownership
- Compliance requirements for multi-tenant data separation were not met

### Risk Assessment
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Impact**: Complete data exposure between businesses
- **Scope**: All inventory management functionality
- **Affected Entities**: Products, Suppliers, and related stock data

## Implementation Details

### 1. Model Changes

#### Product Model Updates
```python
class Product(models.Model):
    # ... existing fields ...
    business = models.ForeignKey(
        Business,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name='products'
    )
    # ... existing fields ...

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ['business', 'sku']  # Prevent duplicate SKUs per business
```

#### Supplier Model Updates
```python
class Supplier(models.Model):
    # ... existing fields ...
    business = models.ForeignKey(
        Business,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name='suppliers'
    )
    # ... existing fields ...

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ['business', 'name']  # Prevent duplicate supplier names per business
```

### 2. View Security Implementation

#### ProductViewSet Security
```python
class ProductViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    # ... existing code ...

    def get_queryset(self):
        """Filter products by user's businesses."""
        user = self.request.user
        business_ids = self._business_ids_for_user(user)
        return Product.objects.filter(business_id__in=business_ids)

    def _business_ids_for_user(self, user):
        """Get all business IDs the user has access to."""
        if user.account_type == User.ACCOUNT_OWNER:
            # Owners can access their own businesses
            memberships = BusinessMembership.objects.filter(
                user=user,
                is_active=True
            ).values_list('business_id', flat=True)
            return list(memberships)
        else:
            # Employees can access businesses through their memberships
            memberships = BusinessMembership.objects.filter(
                user=user,
                is_active=True
            ).values_list('business_id', flat=True)
            return list(memberships)
```

#### SupplierViewSet Security
```python
class SupplierViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    # ... existing code ...

    def get_queryset(self):
        """Filter suppliers by user's businesses."""
        user = self.request.user
        business_ids = self._business_ids_for_user(user)
        return Supplier.objects.filter(business_id__in=business_ids)
```

### 3. Database Migration

#### Migration Strategy
- **Data Assignment**: Created migration to assign existing products to "DataLogique Systems" business
- **Schema Changes**: Made business fields non-nullable after data assignment
- **Constraint Updates**: Added unique constraints for business-scoped uniqueness

#### Migration Code
```python
def assign_business_to_existing_data(apps, schema_editor):
    """Assign DataLogique Systems business to all existing products and suppliers."""
    Business = apps.get_model('accounts', 'Business')
    Product = apps.get_model('inventory', 'Product')
    Supplier = apps.get_model('inventory', 'Supplier')

    # Get the DataLogique Systems business
    business_id = uuid.UUID('43bec7a5-a10f-46fb-9ec1-22e087ba8b7d')
    try:
        business = Business.objects.get(id=business_id)
        Product.objects.filter(business__isnull=True).update(business=business)
        Supplier.objects.filter(business__isnull=True).update(business=business)
    except Business.DoesNotExist:
        pass  # Skip in test environments
```

### 4. Permission System Integration

#### Business Membership Validation
- Leveraged existing `BusinessMembership` model for access control
- Owners can access their own businesses
- Employees can access businesses through active memberships
- Automatic filtering prevents unauthorized data access

#### API Permission Classes
```python
class IsBusinessMember(permissions.BasePermission):
    """Permission class to check if user is member of the business."""

    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        user = request.user
        business_ids = self._get_user_business_ids(user)
        return obj.business_id in business_ids
```

## Security Benefits

### 1. Data Isolation
- **Complete Separation**: Each business's data is completely isolated
- **No Cross-Contamination**: Impossible for users to access other businesses' data
- **Granular Control**: Business-level access control for all inventory entities

### 2. Compliance
- **Multi-Tenant Standards**: Meets SaaS multi-tenancy security requirements
- **Data Privacy**: Protects sensitive business information
- **Audit Compliance**: Clear business ownership tracking

### 3. API Security
- **Automatic Filtering**: All endpoints filter by business ownership
- **Permission Enforcement**: Proper 403 responses for unauthorized access
- **Consistent Behavior**: Uniform security model across all inventory APIs

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
- **Model Tests**: Business field constraints and relationships
- **API Tests**: Permission checks and data isolation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end business scoping validation
- **Security Tests**: Attempted cross-business access prevention

### Test Examples
```python
def test_product_business_scoping(self):
    """Test that users can only access products from their businesses."""
    # Create products for different businesses
    business1_product = Product.objects.create(
        name='Business 1 Product',
        sku='B1P001',
        business=self.business1,
        category=self.category
    )
    business2_product = Product.objects.create(
        name='Business 2 Product',
        sku='B2P001',
        business=self.business2,
        category=self.category
    )

    # User from business1 should only see business1 products
    self.client.force_authenticate(user=self.business1_user)
    response = self.client.get('/inventory/api/products/')
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)
    product_ids = [p['id'] for p in response.data['results']]
    self.assertIn(str(business1_product.id), product_ids)
    self.assertNotIn(str(business2_product.id), product_ids)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- **Indexes**: Added database indexes on business foreign keys
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient business filtering in querysets
- **Caching**: Business membership caching for performance

### API Performance
- **Pagination**: Prevents large result sets
- **Filtering**: Efficient business-based filtering
- **Select Related**: Optimized foreign key queries

## Deployment and Rollback

### Deployment Steps
1. **Pre-deployment**: Backup database
2. **Migration**: Run business scoping migration
3. **Validation**: Test data integrity and access controls
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor for any access issues

### Rollback Plan
1. **Reverse Migration**: Remove business foreign keys
2. **Data Cleanup**: Remove business assignments if needed
3. **API Reversion**: Revert to non-scoped endpoints
4. **Testing**: Validate system functionality

## Future Enhancements
