# 🐛 Bug Fix: Payment Type Filter Validation Error

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Issue:** Payment type filter returning 400 error

---

## 🔴 Problem

When filtering sales by payment type in the frontend, the API was returning:

```json
{
  "payment_type": ["Select a valid choice. CASH is not one of the available choices."]
}
```

**Error Details:**
- **API Call:** `GET /sales/api/sales/?payment_type=CASH`
- **Status Code:** 400 Bad Request
- **Root Cause:** Filter was not configured with valid payment type choices

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**File:** `sales/filters.py`

**Problem Code:**
```python
# ❌ BEFORE (missing choices parameter)
payment_type = filters.ChoiceFilter(
    field_name='payment_type'
)
```

The `ChoiceFilter` was created **without specifying the valid choices**, so it didn't know that 'CASH', 'CARD', etc. were valid options.

---

## ✅ Solution

**File:** `sales/filters.py`

**Fixed Code:**
```python
# ✅ AFTER (with valid choices)
payment_type = filters.ChoiceFilter(
    field_name='payment_type',
    choices=Sale.PAYMENT_TYPE_CHOICES
)
```

Now the filter references `Sale.PAYMENT_TYPE_CHOICES` which includes:
- `CASH` - Cash
- `CARD` - Card
- `MOBILE` - Mobile Money
- `CREDIT` - Credit
- `MIXED` - Mixed Payment

---

## 🧪 Testing Results

```bash
✅ CASH     (Cash           ):  170 sales
✅ CARD     (Card           ):  153 sales
✅ MOBILE   (Mobile Money   ):   68 sales
✅ CREDIT   (Credit         ):   63 sales
✅ MIXED    (Mixed Payment  ):    0 sales
```

All payment types now work correctly!

## 📝 API Usage

### Filter by Payment Type

**Single Payment Type:**
```bash
GET /sales/api/sales/?payment_type=CASH&status=COMPLETED
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "count": 170,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "payment_type": "CASH",
      "total_amount": "125.50",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### Valid Payment Types

| Code | Display Name | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `CASH` | Cash | Cash payment |
| `CARD` | Card | Card payment (debit/credit) |
| `MOBILE` | Mobile Money | Mobile money payment |
| `CREDIT` | Credit | Credit/On account |
| `MIXED` | Mixed Payment | Combination of payment types |

## 🎯 Frontend Integration

No changes needed in frontend! The filter will now work as expected:

```typescript
// This now works correctly ✅
const response = await api.get('/sales/api/sales/', {
  params: {
    payment_type: 'CASH',
    status: 'COMPLETED'
  }
})
```
