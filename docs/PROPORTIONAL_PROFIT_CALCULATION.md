# Proportional Profit Calculation for Credit Sales

## Implementation Date
2025-01-07

## Overview
Enhanced financial summary calculations to properly handle **proportional profit allocation** for credit sales with partial payments. This ensures that cash on hand and outstanding credit accurately reflect the actual financial position.

---

## The Problem

### Previous Implementation (Incorrect)
When a credit sale had partial payment, the system was treating it as **fully outstanding** for profit purposes:

**Example:**
- Credit sale: $1,000 (with $300 profit)
- Customer paid: $400 (40%)
- Outstanding: $600 (60%)

**Old Calculation:**
- Outstanding Credit Profit: **$300** (100% of profit)
- Cash on Hand: Did NOT include the realized $120 profit from the $400 payment

**Issue:** The system wasn't recognizing that 40% of the profit ($120) was already realized when the customer paid $400.

---

## The Solution

### Proportional Profit Allocation

The profit should be split proportionally based on what percentage has been paid:

**New Calculation:**
1. **Calculate total profit** for the sale: $300
2. **Calculate payment percentage**: $400 / $1,000 = 40%
3. **Calculate outstanding percentage**: $600 / $1,000 = 60%
4. **Split profit proportionally**:
   - **Realized Profit** = $300 × 40% = **$120** (included in cash on hand)
   - **Outstanding Profit** = $300 × 60% = **$180** (still in accounts receivable)

**Formula:**
```
Outstanding Profit = Total Sale Profit × (Amount Due / Total Amount)
Realized Profit = Total Sale Profit × (Amount Paid / Total Amount)
Cash on Hand = All Completed Profit - Outstanding Profit
```

---

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes in `sales/views.py`

**Location:** `summary()` action (around lines 400-450)

**Before:**
```python
# Old: Treated all PENDING/PARTIAL profit as outstanding
unpaid_credit_ids = queryset.filter(
    payment_type='CREDIT',
    status__in=['PENDING', 'PARTIAL']
).values_list('id', flat=True)

outstanding_credit_profit = SaleItem.objects.filter(
    sale_id__in=unpaid_credit_ids,
    stock_product__isnull=False
).aggregate(
    profit=Sum(...)
)['profit'] or Decimal('0')
```

**After:**
```python
# New: Calculate profit proportional to amount_due
unpaid_credit_sales = queryset.filter(
    payment_type='CREDIT',
    status__in=['PENDING', 'PARTIAL']
)

outstanding_credit_profit = Decimal('0')
for sale in unpaid_credit_sales:
    # Get total profit for this sale
    sale_profit = SaleItem.objects.filter(
        sale_id=sale.id,
        stock_product__isnull=False
    ).aggregate(
        profit=Sum(
            ExpressionWrapper(
                (F('unit_price') - F('stock_product__unit_cost')) * F('quantity'),
                output_field=DecimalField()
            )
        )
    )['profit'] or Decimal('0')
    
    # Calculate proportional outstanding profit
    if sale.total_amount > 0:
        outstanding_ratio = sale.amount_due / sale.total_amount
        outstanding_credit_profit += sale_profit * outstanding_ratio
```

---

## New Summary Fields

### API Response: `GET /api/sales/summary/`

```json
{
  "summary": {
    // Profit-based metrics (NEW/ENHANCED)
    "total_profit": "450000.00",           // Profit from ALL completed sales
    "outstanding_credit": "55000.00",      // Profit portion still unpaid (proportional)
    "realized_credit_profit": "25000.00",  // NEW: Profit portion already paid
    "cash_on_hand": "395000.00",          // Total profit - outstanding (now correct)
    
    // Revenue-based metrics (UNCHANGED)
    "cash_at_hand": "996864.85",          // Actual cash received
    "accounts_receivable": "156254.48",   // Money still owed
    
    // Other metrics...
  }
}
```

### Field Explanations

| Field | Description | Calculation |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `total_profit` | Total profit from all COMPLETED sales | Sum of (price - cost) × quantity |
| `outstanding_credit` | Profit portion from unpaid amounts | Sum of sale_profit × (amount_due / total_amount) |
| `realized_credit_profit` | Profit portion from paid amounts | Sum of sale_profit × (amount_paid / total_amount) |
| `cash_on_hand` | Realized profit available | total_profit - outstanding_credit |

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fully Unpaid Credit Sale (PENDING)

**Sale Details:**
- Total: $1,000
- Profit: $300
- Paid: $0
- Due: $1,000

**Calculation:**
- Outstanding ratio: $1,000 / $1,000 = 100%
- Outstanding profit: $300 × 100% = **$300**
- Realized profit: $300 × 0% = **$0**

**Result:** All $300 profit is in outstanding credit.

---

### Scenario 2: Partially Paid Credit Sale (PARTIAL)

**Sale Details:**
- Total: $1,000
- Profit: $300
- Paid: $400 (40%)
- Due: $600 (60%)

**Calculation:**
- Outstanding ratio: $600 / $1,000 = 60%
- Outstanding profit: $300 × 60% = **$180**
- Realized profit: $300 × 40% = **$120**

**Result:** 
- $180 profit is in outstanding credit
- $120 profit is in cash on hand

---

### Scenario 3: Fully Paid Credit Sale (COMPLETED)

**Sale Details:**
- Total: $1,000
- Profit: $300
- Paid: $1,000 (100%)
- Due: $0

**Calculation:**
- Outstanding ratio: $0 / $1,000 = 0%
- Outstanding profit: $300 × 0% = **$0**
- Realized profit: $300 × 100% = **$300**

**Result:** All $300 profit is in cash on hand.

## Impact on Financial Reporting

### Before vs After

**Consider a business with:**
- 100 completed cash sales: $50,000 revenue, $15,000 profit
- 50 completed credit sales (fully paid): $30,000 revenue, $9,000 profit
- 20 partial credit sales: $20,000 total, 50% paid ($10,000), $6,000 profit

**Old Calculation:**
```
Total Profit: $24,000
Outstanding Credit: $6,000 (100% of partial sales profit)
Cash on Hand: $18,000

❌ Problem: Doesn't recognize that $3,000 was already paid
```

**New Calculation:**
```
Total Profit: $24,000
Outstanding Credit: $3,000 (50% of partial sales profit)
Realized Credit Profit: $3,000 (50% of partial sales profit)
Cash on Hand: $21,000

✅ Correct: Recognizes $3,000 realized from partial payments
```

**Difference:** Cash on hand increased by $3,000 to accurately reflect realized profit.

---

## Benefits

### 1. **Accurate Financial Position**
- Shows true cash on hand including realized credit profits
- Outstanding credit reflects only unpaid portion of profit

### 2. **Better Cash Flow Visibility**
- Business owners see the actual profit they've collected
- Can make informed decisions about available funds

### 3. **Proportional Tracking**
- As customers make payments, outstanding profit decreases
- Cash on hand profit increases automatically
- No manual adjustments needed

### 4. **Consistent with Revenue Accounting**
- Mirrors the revenue-based `cash_at_hand` and `accounts_receivable` logic
- Both metrics now properly adjust with payments

---

## Testing

### Test File: `test_profit_proportional.py`

Run the test:
```bash
python test_profit_proportional.py
```

**What it tests:**
1. Proportional profit calculation for PARTIAL sales
2. Outstanding vs realized profit split
3. Cash on hand accuracy
4. Comparison with revenue-based metrics

**Expected Output:**
```

## Frontend Integration

### TypeScript Interface

```typescript
interface FinancialSummary {
  // Profit-based metrics
  total_profit: string;           // All completed sales profit
  outstanding_credit: string;     // Unpaid profit (proportional)
  realized_credit_profit: string; // Paid profit (proportional)
  cash_on_hand: string;          // Realized profit
  
  // Revenue-based metrics
  cash_at_hand: string;          // Actual cash received
  accounts_receivable: string;   // Money owed
  
  // Other fields...
}
```

### Display Example

```typescript
// Dashboard Widget
export const FinancialSummaryWidget: React.FC = () => {
  const [summary, setSummary] = useState<FinancialSummary | null>(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/sales/summary/')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setSummary(data.summary));
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div className="financial-summary">
      <h3>Financial Position</h3>
      
      <div className="metrics">
        <div className="metric profit-based">

        <p>
          💡 <strong>Insight:</strong> You've realized ${summary.realized_credit_profit} 
          in profit from partial credit payments. This is already in your cash on hand.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Business Rules

### Rule 1: Proportional Allocation
- Profit is split based on payment percentage
- Formula: `profit × (amount / total)`
- Applied to both outstanding and realized portions

### Rule 2: Automatic Updates
- When payment is recorded:
  - `amount_paid` increases
  - `amount_due` decreases
  - Outstanding profit recalculates automatically
  - Cash on hand profit increases automatically

### Rule 3: Status Transitions
- **PENDING → PARTIAL:** First payment triggers proportional split
- **PARTIAL → PARTIAL:** Each payment adjusts the ratio
- **PARTIAL → COMPLETED:** Final payment moves all profit to cash on hand

### Rule 4: Completed Sales
- All COMPLETED sales (cash or credit) contribute to total_profit
- Only PENDING/PARTIAL credit sales have outstanding profit
- COMPLETED credit sales have 100% realized profit

## Migration Notes

### Data Migration
No data migration needed - this is a calculation change only.

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing fields remain unchanged
- New field added: `realized_credit_profit`
- Existing integrations continue to work

### Performance Considerations
- Loops through PENDING/PARTIAL sales only (typically small subset)
- Uses existing database queries
- No significant performance impact

**Optimization for large datasets:**
If you have many PENDING/PARTIAL sales, consider adding a database field to cache the realized profit ratio.

## Comparison: Revenue vs Profit Metrics

### When to Use Each

| Metric Type | Best For | Example Use Case |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| **Revenue-Based** | Cash flow management, accounting | "How much cash do I have to pay bills?" |
| **Profit-Based** | Business performance, profitability | "How much money have I actually made?" |

### Both Are Important

```
Revenue Metrics (Cash Accounting):
✓ Cash at Hand: $996,864.85
✓ Accounts Receivable: $156,254.48
✓ Shows actual cash position

Profit Metrics (Value Accounting):
✓ Cash on Hand: $395,000.00
✓ Outstanding Credit: $55,000.00
✓ Realized Credit: $25,000.00
✓ Shows actual value created
```

**Key Insight:** A sale with high revenue but low profit margin will show in cash_at_hand but contribute less to cash_on_hand (profit).

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Numbers Don't Match Expected

**Check:**
1. Are StockProducts linked to SaleItems?
2. Is `unit_cost` set on StockProducts?
3. Are sales in COMPLETED status?

**Debug Query:**
```python
# Check sales with missing cost data
from sales.models import SaleItem

items_without_cost = SaleItem.objects.filter(
    stock_product__isnull=True
).count()

print(f"Items without stock_product: {items_without_cost}")
```

### Issue: Outstanding Profit Seems High

**Likely Cause:** Many unpaid credit sales

**Verify:**
```python
from sales.models import Sale

pending_partial = Sale.objects.filter(
    payment_type='CREDIT',
    status__in=['PENDING', 'PARTIAL']
)

print(f"Unpaid credit sales: {pending_partial.count()}")
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Cost Basis Options
Currently uses `stock_product.unit_cost` (base cost). Could add options for:
- Landed cost (including tax, shipping)
- Average cost
- FIFO cost

### 2. Profit Margin Reporting
Track profit margins by:
- Product category
- Customer segment
- Time period
- Sales channel

### 3. Predictive Analytics
Use payment patterns to predict:
- Expected collection timeline
- Risk of non-payment
- Working capital needs
