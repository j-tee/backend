# Stock Reconciliation Database Verification Report

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Purpose:** Verify stock reconciliation calculations with actual database queries  
**Status:** ‚úÖ VERIFIED - Formula is correct, reveals real inventory discrepancies

---

## Executive Summary

Ran extensive database queries to verify the stock reconciliation formula fix. The corrected formula **is working properly** and reveals **real inventory discrepancies** that need investigation.

### Key Findings:

1. ‚úÖ **Formula is mathematically correct** - subtracting sold units as expected
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **90% of products show discrepancies** - only 1 out of 10 balanced
3. üìä **Average discrepancy: 33.4 units** - significant inventory variance
4. üîç **Negative deltas indicate shortage** - more activity than recorded stock
5. üîç **Positive deltas indicate surplus** - more stock than accounted for

## Sample Product Analysis: Customer Display (DL-CDS-006)

### Raw Database Values

```
Product: Customer Display
SKU: DL-CDS-006
Product ID: 06d8b99d-7feb-4078-b0fe-a7d61a59f1e4
```

#### Step 1: Warehouse Inventory (Current Stock)
```
DataLogique Central Warehouse: 113 units
TOTAL: 113 units
```

#### Step 2: Storefront Inventory (Current Stock)
```
Adenta Store: 79 units
TOTAL: 79 units
```

#### Step 3: Sold Units (Completed Sales)
```
Total Completed Sales: 17 transactions
Sample transactions:
  - Sale 77f8a1ca: 1.00 units on 2025-10-01
  - Sale 758c5b94: 3.00 units on 2025-09-29
  - Sale f829165e: 3.00 units on 2025-09-24
  - Sale 601d3ca6: 1.00 units on 2025-09-21
  - Sale a9dc3a6c: 2.00 units on 2025-09-02
  ... (12 more transactions)

TOTAL SOLD: 49.00 units
```

#### Step 4: Recorded Batch Quantity
```
Batch b66c0de4: 113 units
Supplier: DataLogique Preferred Supplier
Created: 2025-10-07
TOTAL: 113 units
```

### Reconciliation Calculation

**Corrected Formula:**
```
Calculated Baseline = Warehouse + Storefront - Sold - Shrinkage + Corrections - Reservations
```

**With Actual Values:**
```
Calculated Baseline = 113 + 79 - 49 - 0 + 0 - 0
                    = 143 units
```

**Delta Calculation:**
```
Delta = Recorded Batch - Calculated Baseline
      = 113 - 143
      = -30 units
```

### Interpretation

**‚ö†Ô∏è SHORTAGE of 30 units**

The negative delta indicates the system shows **MORE inventory movement** than the recorded stock batch.

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Incomplete batch recording** - Only 113 units recorded, but actual batch was larger
2. **Missing batch entries** - Additional stock arrivals not logged
3. **Transfer tracking issue** - Stock transferred to storefront (79 units) not fully accounted
4. **Initial inventory errors** - Starting inventory count was incorrect

**Recommendation:** Review stock arrival records from October 7, 2025 and earlier to verify if all incoming batches were properly recorded.

## Formula Verification

### Correct Formula (IMPLEMENTED)

```python
formula_baseline = (
    warehouse_on_hand           # Current warehouse inventory
    + storefront_total_decimal  # Current storefront inventory
    - completed_units           # ‚úÖ SUBTRACT sold units (they're gone)
    - shrinkage_units           # Subtract damaged/lost units
    + correction_units          # Add adjustment corrections
    - reservations_linked_units # Subtract reserved units
)
```

### Database Query Used

```python
# Warehouse inventory
warehouse_total = Inventory.objects.filter(
    product=product
).aggregate(total=Sum('quantity'))['total'] or Decimal('0')

# Storefront inventory
storefront_total = StoreFrontInventory.objects.filter(
    product=product
).aggregate(total=Sum('quantity'))['total'] or Decimal('0')

# Sold units (completed sales only)
sold_total = SaleItem.objects.filter(
    product=product,
    sale__status='COMPLETED'
).aggregate(total=Sum('quantity'))['total'] or Decimal('0')

# Recorded batch quantity
batch_total = StockProduct.objects.filter(
    product=product
).aggregate(total=Sum('quantity'))['total'] or Decimal('0')

# Calculate
calculated_baseline = warehouse_total + storefront_total - sold_total
delta = batch_total - calculated_baseline
```

## Interpretation Guide

### Understanding Delta Values

#### Positive Delta (Surplus)
```
Example: DL-PPR-005 has delta of +59 units
Meaning: Batch shows 59 MORE units than calculated
Causes: 
  - Unrecorded sales
  - Unreported shrinkage
  - Inventory count errors (overcounted)
  - Missing transfers
```

#### Negative Delta (Shortage)
```
Example: DL-CDS-006 has delta of -30 units
Meaning: Batch shows 30 FEWER units than calculated
Causes:
  - Incomplete batch recording
  - Missing stock arrivals
  - Duplicate sales
  - Inventory count errors (undercounted)
```

#### Zero Delta (Balanced)
```
Example: DL-SFT-010 has delta of 0
Meaning: Perfect reconciliation
Status: All units accounted for ‚úÖ
```

## Data Quality Observations

### 1. Transfer Tracking
```
Many products show:
  - Warehouse: 70-113 units
  - Storefront: 40-79 units
  - Total: 110-192 units

This indicates active transfer system is working
```

### 2. Sales Tracking
```
Sold units range: 0-103 units per product
Example: DL-PPR-005 has 103 sold units
This shows sales are being recorded
```

### 3. Batch Recording
```
All products have recorded batches (63-113 units)
Batches created on: 2025-10-07
Supplier: DataLogique Preferred Supplier (consistent)
```

### 4. Discrepancy Patterns

**Pattern A: Large Positive Delta (Surplus)**
- Products: SUM-CASH (+102), SUM-CREDIT (+100), DL-PPR-005 (+59)
- Likely cause: Special products (summary/totals) or high-turnover items
- Action: Verify these are actual products vs. system placeholders

**Pattern B: Large Negative Delta (Shortage)**
- Product: DL-CDS-006 (-30)
- Likely cause: Incomplete batch recording
- Action: Review stock arrival documentation

**Pattern C: Small Discrepancies (+3 to +8)**
- Products: Multiple (4 products)
- Likely cause: Rounding, minor count errors, or recent adjustments
- Action: Physical count verification

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify Special Products**
   - Investigate SUM-CASH and SUM-CREDIT products
   - Confirm these are real products vs. summary entries
   - If summary entries, exclude from reconciliation

2. **Physical Count - High Discrepancy Items**
   - DL-CDS-006 (Customer Display): -30 units
   - DL-PPR-005 (Receipt Paper): +59 units
   - DL-CSD-004 (Cash Drawer): +18 units
   - Conduct physical inventory count to determine actual stock

3. **Review October 7 Stock Arrivals**
   - All batches created on same date (2025-10-07)
   - Verify if this was a single large shipment
   - Check for any missing batch entries

### Process Improvements

1. **Enable Automatic Shrinkage Tracking**
   - Currently all products show 0 shrinkage
   - Implement damage/loss recording system
   - This will improve reconciliation accuracy

2. **Implement Batch Splitting**
   - Large batches (100+ units) should be verified
   - Consider breaking into warehouse + storefront batches
   - Improves traceability

3. **Regular Reconciliation Reports**
   - Run weekly reconciliation checks
   - Flag products with delta > 10 units
   - Investigate and resolve before month-end

4. **Correction Workflow**
   - Add stock adjustment feature for corrections
   - Track adjustment reasons (count error, damage, theft)
   - This will populate correction_units field

## Formula Validation

### Before Fix (WRONG)
```python
formula_baseline = warehouse + storefront + sold  # ‚ùå ADDING sold
```

Example with DL-CDS-006:
```
113 + 79 + 49 = 241 (WRONG!)
Delta = 113 - 241 = -128 (Meaningless)
```

### After Fix (CORRECT)
```python
formula_baseline = warehouse + storefront - sold  # ‚úÖ SUBTRACTING sold
```

Example with DL-CDS-006:
```
113 + 79 - 49 = 143 (CORRECT!)
Delta = 113 - 143 = -30 (Real discrepancy revealed)
```

**‚úÖ The fix is working correctly** - deltas now represent actual inventory discrepancies.

## SQL Queries Used (Reference)

```sql
-- Warehouse Inventory
SELECT warehouse.name, SUM(quantity) as total
FROM inventory_inventory
JOIN inventory_warehouse ON inventory_inventory.warehouse_id = inventory_warehouse.id
WHERE product_id = '06d8b99d-7feb-4078-b0fe-a7d61a59f1e4'
GROUP BY warehouse.name;

-- Storefront Inventory
SELECT storefront.name, SUM(quantity) as total
FROM inventory_storefrontinventory
JOIN inventory_storefront ON inventory_storefrontinventory.storefront_id = inventory_storefront.id
WHERE product_id = '06d8b99d-7feb-4078-b0fe-a7d61a59f1e4'
GROUP BY storefront.name;

-- Sold Units
SELECT SUM(quantity) as total_sold
FROM sales_saleitem
JOIN sales_sale ON sales_saleitem.sale_id = sales_sale.id
WHERE sales_saleitem.product_id = '06d8b99d-7feb-4078-b0fe-a7d61a59f1e4'
  AND sales_sale.status = 'COMPLETED';

-- Batch Quantity
SELECT SUM(quantity) as total_batch
FROM inventory_stockproduct
WHERE product_id = '06d8b99d-7feb-4078-b0fe-a7d61a59f1e4';
```
