## 🎯 How to Use These Docs

### If you're implementing a new feature:
1. Check if a guide exists in `FRONTEND_GUIDES_INDEX.md`
2. Read the summary document (if available)
3. Follow the complete guide
4. Use the checklist to track progress

### If you're debugging:
1. Check the guide for the feature you're working on
2. Look at the "Common Issues" section
3. Compare your code with the examples
4. Check the network tab against the documented responses

### If you have questions:
1. Check the guide's "Questions?" section
2. Test the API endpoint directly with Postman/curl
3. Share the network request/response with the backend team
4. Describe expected vs actual behavior

## ✅ Quick Reference

### All Edit Endpoints
```
GET    /inventory/api/stock-adjustments/           List
GET    /inventory/api/stock-adjustments/{id}/      Detail
POST   /inventory/api/stock-adjustments/           Create
PUT    /inventory/api/stock-adjustments/{id}/      Update (full)
PATCH  /inventory/api/stock-adjustments/{id}/      Update (partial)
```

### Authentication
All requests need:
```typescript
headers: {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

### Common Response Codes
- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created

## �� Document Updates

These documents are updated when:
- ✅ New backend features are added
- ✅ API contracts change
- ✅ New patterns are established
- ✅ Common issues are identified

**Last Update:** 2025-10-09

## 💡 Tips

1. **Always use TypeScript interfaces** - They're kept in sync with backend serializers
2. **Don't calculate on frontend** - Backend handles all business logic
3. **Display backend errors** - They're written for end users
4. **Check status before actions** - Respect permission rules (e.g., only edit PENDING)
5. **Test error states** - Not just the happy path

## 📞 Getting Help

### For Implementation Questions:
- Read the specific guide thoroughly
- Check the React examples
- Test the endpoint with Postman first

### For Backend Issues:
- Share the network request/response
- Include error messages
- Note the endpoint and method

### For New Features:
- Check if the backend endpoint exists
- Request documentation if missing
- Work with backend team to add if needed
