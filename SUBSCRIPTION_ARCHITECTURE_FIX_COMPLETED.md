# Subscription Architecture Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Critical Issue Resolved

### Problem Identified:
✗ Subscription was **USER-CENTRIC** (subscriptions linked to users)  
✗ Users couldn't own multiple businesses with separate subscriptions  
✗ Subscription status stored on User model instead of Business

### Solution Implemented:
✓ Subscription now **BUSINESS-CENTRIC** (one subscription per business)  
✓ Users can own/access multiple businesses, each with own subscription  
✓ Subscription status moved to Business model  
✓ User has audit trail role only (created_by field)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Subscription Model (`subscriptions/models.py`)
```python
# BEFORE (WRONG):
user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
business = models.OneToOneField(Business, null=True, blank=True)  # Optional!

# AFTER (CORRECT):
business = models.OneToOneField(Business, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # REQUIRED
created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)  # Audit only
```

**Benefits:**
- Each business has exactly ONE subscription
- Same user can manage multiple businesses with separate subscriptions
- Business transfers don't lose subscription history
- Clear ownership model

### 2. Business Model (`accounts/models.py`)
```python
# ADDED:
subscription_status = models.CharField(
    max_length=20,
    choices=SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS_CHOICES,
    default='INACTIVE'
)

def has_active_subscription(self):
    """Check if business has active subscription"""
    try:
        return self.subscription.is_active()
    except AttributeError:
        return False

def get_subscription_limits(self):
    """Get plan limits"""
    return {
        'max_users': self.subscription.plan.max_users,
        'max_storefronts': self.subscription.plan.max_storefronts,
        ...
    }

def sync_subscription_status(self):
    """Sync subscription_status field with subscription"""
    self.subscription_status = self.subscription.status
    self.save(update_fields=['subscription_status'])
```

### 3. User Model (`accounts/models.py`)
```python
# REMOVED:
subscription_status = models.CharField(...)  # Deleted - belongs to Business

# UPDATED:
def has_active_subscription(self):
    """User has access if member of ANY business with active subscription"""
    return self.business_memberships.filter(
        is_active=True,
        business__subscription__status__in=['ACTIVE', 'TRIAL']
    ).exists()

def get_businesses_with_active_subscriptions(self):
    """Get all businesses user can access with active subscriptions"""
    memberships = self.business_memberships.filter(
        is_active=True,
        business__subscription__status__in=['ACTIVE', 'TRIAL']
    )
    return [m.business for m in memberships]
```

### 4. Admin Interface (`accounts/admin.py`)
```python
# UserAdmin:
- Removed 'subscription_status' from list_display and list_filter
+ Added 'account_type', 'platform_role'
+ Reorganized fieldsets

# BusinessAdmin:
+ Added 'subscription_status' to list_display and list_filter
+ Added proper fieldsets with subscription status
```

## Migration Strategy

### Status:
- ✅ Accounts migration created: `0006_remove_user_subscription_status_and_more.py`
- ✅ Subscriptions migration created: `0002_alert_alter_subscriptionplan_options_and_more.py`
- ✅ No existing subscriptions in database (safe to migrate)
- ⏳ Ready to apply migrations

### What the Migrations Do:

**accounts/0006:**
1. Removes `subscription_status` from User model
2. Adds `subscription_status` to Business model

**subscriptions/0002:**
1. Removes `user` field from Subscription
2. Adds `business` field (OneToOneField) to Subscription
3. Adds `created_by` field for audit trail
4. Adds Alert model
5. Adds new fields (currency, is_popular, sort_order, trial_period_days)
6. Updates indexes to use business instead of user

---

## Workflow Changes

### OLD Workflow (WRONG):
```
1. User registers → user1@example.com
2. User subscribes → Subscription linked to user1@example.com
3. User creates Business A
4. User wants Business B → ❌ MUST create user2@example.com
```

### NEW Workflow (CORRECT):
```
1. User registers → user1@example.com
2. User creates Business A
3. Business A subscribes → Subscription for Business A
4. User creates Business B
5. Business B subscribes → Subscription for Business B
6. ✅ Same user (user1@example.com) manages both businesses
```

---

## Access Control Logic

### Business + Subscription Check:
```python
def check_access(user, business_id, action):
    # 1. Is user a member of this business?
    membership = BusinessMembership.objects.filter(
        user=user,
        business_id=business_id,
        is_active=True
    ).first()
    
    if not membership:
        return False, "Not authorized for this business"
    
    # 2. Does business have active subscription?
    if not membership.business.has_active_subscription():
        return False, "Business subscription inactive"
    
    # 3. Check subscription limits
    limits = membership.business.get_subscription_limits()
    if action == 'create_user':
        current_count = membership.business.memberships.count()
        if current_count >= limits['max_users']:
            return False, "User limit reached for this business"
    
    return True, "OK"
```

---

## API Changes Required

### Subscription Creation:
```python
# OLD:
POST /subscriptions/
{
    "plan_id": "uuid",
    "user_id": "uuid"  # WRONG
}

# NEW:
POST /subscriptions/
{
    "plan_id": "uuid",
    "business_id": "uuid"  # CORRECT
}
```

### Permission Checks (Example):
```python
# OLD:
if not request.user.has_active_subscription():
    return 403

# NEW:
business = get_business_from_request(request)
if not business.has_active_subscription():
    return 403
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User with Multiple Businesses
```python
# User John owns 2 businesses
john = User.objects.get(email='john@example.com')

# Business A - Active subscription
business_a = Business.objects.create(owner=john, name='Shop A')
sub_a = Subscription.objects.create(
    business=business_a,
    created_by=john,
    plan=premium_plan,
    status='ACTIVE'
)

# Business B - Trial subscription
business_b = Business.objects.create(owner=john, name='Shop B')
sub_b = Subscription.objects.create(
    business=business_b,
    created_by=john,
    plan=basic_plan,
    status='TRIAL'
)

# ✅ John has access to both businesses
assert business_a.has_active_subscription() == True
assert business_b.has_active_subscription() == True
assert john.has_active_subscription() == True
```

### Scenario 2: Employee Access
```python
# Employee Sarah works at Business A only
sarah = User.objects.get(email='sarah@example.com')
BusinessMembership.objects.create(
    user=sarah,
    business=business_a,
    role='STAFF'
)

# ✅ Sarah has access through Business A's subscription
assert sarah.has_active_subscription() == True
assert sarah.can_access_storefront(business_a_storefront_id) == True
assert sarah.can_access_storefront(business_b_storefront_id) == False
```

### Scenario 3: Subscription Expiry
```python
# Business A subscription expires
sub_a.status = 'EXPIRED'
sub_a.save()
business_a.sync_subscription_status()

# ✅ Status synced to business
assert business_a.subscription_status == 'EXPIRED'
assert business_a.has_active_subscription() == False

# John still has access through Business B
assert john.has_active_subscription() == True  # Via Business B
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required):
1. ✅ **DONE:** Update models (Subscription, Business, User)
2. ✅ **DONE:** Create migrations
3. ⏳ **TODO:** Apply migrations:

   python manage.py migrate subscriptions
   ```

### Phase 2 (Update Code):
4. Update subscription views/serializers (business-centric)
5. Update permission decorators/classes

## Benefits of New Architecture

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Multi-Business** | ❌ Need separate emails | ✅ Same user, multiple businesses |
| **Ownership** | ❌ Subscription tied to user | ✅ Subscription belongs to business |
| **Status Tracking** | ❌ User.subscription_status | ✅ Business.subscription_status |
| **Access Control** | ❌ User-based only | ✅ Business + Membership based |
| **Scalability** | ❌ Limited | ✅ Unlimited businesses per user |
| **Business Transfer** | ❌ Lose subscription | ✅ Keep subscription |
| **Employee Access** | ❌ Confusing | ✅ Clear (via membership) |

---

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /subscriptions/` now requires `business_id` instead of implicit user
- `GET /subscriptions/me/` needs business context
- All subscription endpoints need business_id parameter or header

### Serializers:
- SubscriptionSerializer now includes `business`, not `user`
- Need to add `business_name` to response
- Add `created_by_name` for audit trail

### Permission Classes:
- Check `business.has_active_subscription()` instead of `user.has_active_subscription()`
- Need business context in all protected endpoints

---

## Migration Safety

### Verified Safe Because:
1. ✅ No existing subscriptions in database (count = 0)
2. ✅ Migration 0002 not yet applied
3. ✅ Fresh migration created with correct structure
4. ✅ No data loss risk

### If Subscriptions Existed:
Would need manual data migration:
```python
# Map existing user subscriptions to their businesses
for sub in Subscription.objects.filter(business__isnull=True):
    # Get user's first/primary business
    business = sub.user.owned_businesses.first()
    sub.business = business
    sub.created_by = sub.user
    sub.save()
```

---

## Status: ✅ READY TO MIGRATE

**Command to run:**
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/teejay/Documents/Projects/pos/backend

# Apply migrations
/home/teejay/Documents/Projects/pos/backend/venv/bin/python manage.py migrate accounts
/home/teejay/Documents/Projects/pos/backend/venv/bin/python manage.py migrate subscriptions

# Verify
/home/teejay/Documents/Projects/pos/backend/venv/bin/python manage.py showmigrations
```

**Expected Output:**
```
accounts
 [X] 0001_initial
 [X] 0002_...
 [X] 0006_remove_user_subscription_status_and_more

subscriptions
 [X] 0001_initial
 [X] 0002_alert_alter_subscriptionplan_options_and_more
```
