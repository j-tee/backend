# Deployment Configuration Complete

âœ… **Production deployment is now fully configured and operational!**

## What was set up:

### 1. SSH Keys for GitHub Actions
- Configured `gha_ci` SSH key pair
- Added to GitHub repository secrets

### 2. Server Setup
- Cloned repository to `/var/www/pos/backend`
- Created Python virtual environment
- Created PostgreSQL database `pos_db`
- Configured `.env.production` with database credentials

### 3. Systemd Services
- **gunicorn.service** - Django application server
- **celery.service** - Background task worker
- **celery-beat.service** - Periodic task scheduler

All services are running and enabled for auto-start.

### 4. Passwordless Sudo
Configured for the `deploy` user to restart services without password prompts:
- systemctl restart gunicorn/celery/celery-beat
- nginx reload

### 5. GitHub Actions Workflow
The deployment workflow automatically:
1. Runs tests on every push to main
2. Deploys to production if tests pass
3. Pulls latest code
4. Runs migrations
5. Collects static files
6. Restarts services
7. Reloads nginx

## Deployment triggered by:
- Push to `main` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

## Next steps:
1. Create superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
2. Configure nginx upstream to point to `/var/www/pos/backend/gunicorn.sock`
3. Set up SSL certificates for HTTPS
4. Configure domain DNS to point to server
