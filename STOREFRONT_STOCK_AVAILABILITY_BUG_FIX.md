# Storefront Stock Availability Bug - Fixed

## üêõ Bug Description

**Symptom:** Frontend shows "11 laptops available" but backend rejects adding 4 units with error "Available: 2.00"

**Root Cause:** The `AddSaleItemSerializer.validate()` method was calculating storefront availability incorrectly:
```python
# WRONG - Only considered completed sales
available = storefront_inventory.quantity - completed_sales
# Result: 11 - 0 = 11 available ‚ùå
```

**Missing Factor:** Active stock reservations from DRAFT sales were not included in the calculation.

## üîç Investigation Results

### Database State
```
HP Laptop 15" at Storefront cc45f197-b169-4be2-a769-99138fd02d5b:

- Completed sales: 0 units  
- Active reservations: 8 units (from 2 DRAFT sales)
- ACTUAL available: 11 - 0 - 8 = 3 units ‚úÖ
```

### Active Reservations Found
```
Sale ID: 2a679396-8120-4456-876d-355106dff1df
  - Quantity: 4 units
  - Expires: 2025-10-14 01:34:47

Sale ID: 8f17e58f-0992-4f41-b843-072f29420142

```

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

### Location
`sales/serializers.py` - `AddSaleItemSerializer.validate()` method (lines 590-640)

### Changes Made

**BEFORE:**
```python
# Only counted completed sales
sold_from_storefront = SaleItem.objects.filter(
    product=product,
    sale__storefront=storefront,
    sale__status='COMPLETED'
).aggregate(total=Sum('quantity'))['total'] or Decimal('0')

available_at_storefront = storefront_inv.quantity - sold_from_storefront
```

**AFTER:**
```python
# Count both completed sales AND active reservations
sold_from_storefront = SaleItem.objects.filter(
    product=product,
    sale__storefront=storefront,
    sale__status='COMPLETED'
).aggregate(total=Sum('quantity'))['total'] or Decimal('0')

# NEW: Get active reservations at this storefront
reserved_quantity = Decimal('0')
reservations_query = StockReservation.objects.filter(
    stock_product__product=product,
    status='ACTIVE'
)

# Exclude current sale's reservations (they'll be updated)
if current_sale_id:
    reservations_query = reservations_query.exclude(
        cart_session_id=str(current_sale_id)
    )

# Only count reservations from sales at THIS storefront
for reservation in reservations_query:
    try:
        sale_id = UUID(str(reservation.cart_session_id))
        sale = Sale.objects.filter(id=sale_id, storefront=storefront).first()
        if sale:
            reserved_quantity += Decimal(str(reservation.quantity))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        pass

# Calculate available (subtract BOTH sold and reserved)
available_at_storefront = storefront_inv.quantity - sold_from_storefront - reserved_quantity
```

### Improved Error Message
Now includes breakdown:
```
Insufficient storefront inventory for "HP Laptop 15"". 
Available: 3.00, Requested: 4. 
(Total: 11, Sold: 0, Reserved: 8) 
Create a transfer request to move more stock to this storefront.
```

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario 1: Adding Item to New Cart
```
Storefront Inventory: 11 units
Completed Sales: 0 units
Active Reservations: 8 units (other carts)
Available: 11 - 0 - 8 = 3 units

‚úÖ Can add 1-3 units (will create new reservation)
‚ùå Cannot add 4+ units (insufficient after reservations)
```

### Scenario 2: Updating Item in Existing Cart
```
Storefront Inventory: 11 units
Completed Sales: 0 units
Active Reservations: 8 units
Current Cart Reservation: 2 units (excluded from calculation)

Available for THIS cart: 11 - 0 - (8-2) = 5 units

‚úÖ Can update to 1-5 units  
‚ùå Cannot update to 6+ units
```

### Scenario 3: Completing a Sale
```
Before completion:
- Storefront Inventory: 11 units
- Reservations: 8 units
- Available: 3 units

After completing 4-unit sale:
- Storefront Inventory: 11 units (unchanged)
- Completed Sales: 4 units (new)
- Reservations: 4 units (one released)
- Available: 11 - 4 - 4 = 3 units
```

## üîÑ Consistency Across System

This fix ensures the `AddSaleItemSerializer` calculation matches other parts of the system:

### 1. StockAvailabilityView (inventory/views.py)
Already correctly calculates:
```python
total_available = storefront_inventory.quantity
reserved_quantity = StockReservation.objects.filter(...).aggregate(...)
unreserved_quantity = total_available - reserved_quantity
```

### 2. Sale.commit_stock() (sales/models.py)
Correctly checks storefront inventory when completing sale:
```python
current_qty = storefront_inventory.quantity
if current_qty < quantity_required:
    raise ValidationError("Insufficient storefront stock")
```

### 3. Frontend Stock Display
Should now see consistent availability across:
- Product search results
- Add to cart validation  
- Cart quantity updates
- Checkout process

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Check current state:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell
   from sales.models import StockReservation
   from inventory.models import Product
   
   laptop = Product.objects.get(name__icontains='HP Laptop')
   reservations = StockReservation.objects.filter(
       stock_product__product=laptop, status='ACTIVE'
   )
   print(f'Reserved: {sum(r.quantity for r in reservations)}')
   ```

2. **Try adding item:**
   - Should now correctly show available = total - sold - reserved
   - Error message should show breakdown

3. **Complete one cart:**
   - Should release its reservation
   - Should make those units available for new carts

### Automated Testing
```python
def test_storefront_availability_with_reservations():
    # Setup: 10 units in storefront
    # Create cart 1 with 4 units (active reservation)
    # Create cart 2 with 3 units (active reservation)
    # Available should be: 10 - 0 - 7 = 3 units
    
    # Try to add 4 units to cart 3
    # Should fail with "Available: 3"
    
    # Try to add 2 units to cart 3  
    # Should succeed
```

## üìä Impact Analysis

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå Multiple users could add items beyond storefront capacity
- ‚ùå Checkout would fail with cryptic errors
- ‚ùå Frontend showed misleading availability
- ‚ùå Race conditions in high-traffic scenarios

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Accurate availability calculation at all times
- ‚úÖ Reservations properly tracked across carts
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages with breakdowns
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior system-wide
- ‚úÖ Prevents overselling at storefront level

---

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Required Actions
1. ‚úÖ Code fix applied to `sales/serializers.py`
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Check for expired reservations before deployment
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Clear any stale DRAFT sales if needed

### Cleanup Script (Optional)
```python
# Clean up expired reservations
from sales.models import StockReservation
from django.utils import timezone

expired = StockReservation.objects.filter(
    status='ACTIVE',
    expires_at__lt=timezone.now()
)
print(f'Found {expired.count()} expired reservations')
expired.update(status='EXPIRED')
```

### Monitoring
After deployment, monitor:
- Cart abandonment rate (should decrease)
- "Add to cart" failure rate (should show accurate errors)
- Checkout completion rate (should improve)
