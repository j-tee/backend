## 🎯 What Works Now

### 1. Create Sales with Type
```typescript
// Create RETAIL sale
POST /sales/api/sales/
{ "storefront": "uuid", "type": "RETAIL", "status": "DRAFT" }

// Create WHOLESALE sale
POST /sales/api/sales/
{ "storefront": "uuid", "type": "WHOLESALE", "status": "DRAFT" }
```
✅ **Working**

### 2. Auto-Pricing
```typescript
// Add item - NO unit_price needed!
POST /sales/api/sales/{id}/add_item/
{ "product": "uuid", "quantity": 10 }

// Backend automatically uses:
// - wholesale_price if sale.type = 'WHOLESALE'
// - retail_price if sale.type = 'RETAIL'
```
✅ **Working**

### 3. Toggle Sale Type
```typescript
// Toggle between RETAIL ↔ WHOLESALE
POST /sales/api/sales/{id}/toggle_sale_type/
{}

// All item prices update automatically
```
✅ **Working**

### 4. Price Display
```tsx
// Shows both prices, highlights active one
<div className="dual-price">
  <div className={saleType === 'RETAIL' ? 'active' : ''}>
    Retail: GH₵ 3.12
  </div>
  <div className={saleType === 'WHOLESALE' ? 'active' : ''}>
    Wholesale: GH₵ 2.65
  </div>
</div>
```
✅ **Working**

## 🐛 Bug Fixed

### Toggle Reset Bug ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Toggle button immediately reset after clicking  
**Cause**: `prepareFreshSale()` was resetting saleType to 'RETAIL'  
**Fix**: Removed `setSaleType('RETAIL')` from `prepareFreshSale()`  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed and documented

**See**: `FRONTEND_WHOLESALE_TOGGLE_BUG_FIX.md` for details

### 📝 Full Audit Trail ✅
Every sale type change logged with who, when, what changed.

Sale type saved in database for reporting and analytics.

## 📊 Real-World Example

### Example: Daily Sales Report

**Before (Retail Only):**
```
Total Sales: GH₵ 5,000
Number of Transactions: 50
Average Transaction: GH₵ 100
```

**After (Retail + Wholesale):**
```
Retail Sales: GH₵ 3,500 (35 transactions, avg: GH₵ 100)
Wholesale Sales: GH₵ 1,500 (15 transactions, avg: GH₵ 100)
Total Sales: GH₵ 5,000 (50 transactions)

Insights:

- Can analyze profit margins by type
```

## 🎓 Business Rules

### When to Use Wholesale

**Recommended Scenarios:**
1. Bulk purchases (10+ units)
2. Registered wholesale customers
3. B2B transactions
4. Volume discounts
5. Special promotions

### Pricing Guidelines

**Example Structure:**
```
Cost Price: GH₵ 2.00
↓
Retail Price: GH₵ 3.12 (56% markup) ← Walk-in customers
↓
Wholesale Price: GH₵ 2.65 (33% markup) ← Bulk buyers
```

**Rule**: Wholesale price should:
- Be lower than retail (10-30% discount)
- Still be profitable (above cost)
- Reflect volume discount

---

## 📈 Reporting Capabilities

### What You Can Track Now

**By Sale Type:**
```sql
-- Sales breakdown
SELECT
  type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(total_amount) as revenue,
  AVG(total_amount) as avg_transaction
FROM sales
WHERE status = 'COMPLETED'
  AND DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY type;
```

**Results:**
```
type       | count | revenue  | avg_transaction
-----------|-------|----------|----------------
RETAIL     | 35    | 3500.00  | 100.00
WHOLESALE  | 15    | 1500.00  | 100.00
```

### Future Enhancements
