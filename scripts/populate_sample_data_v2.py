FIXED Sample Data Population Script - Follows Correct Stock Flow
Generates realistic business data with proper data integrity

CORRECT FLOW:
1. Warehouse Stock Intake → StockProduct
2. Transfer Request → StoreFront requests stock
3. Fulfillment → Stock moves to StoreFrontInventory  
4. Sales → Reduces storefront inventory (NOT warehouse)

This ensures reconciliation balances correctly.

⚠️  WARNING: populate_sample_data.py has data integrity issues!
    
The current script creates sales directly from warehouse stock without:
1. Creating transfer requests
2. Fulfilling requests to move stock to storefronts
3. Updating StoreFrontInventory

This causes reconciliation mismatches (e.g., "135 units over accounted").

USE populate_sample_data_v2.py instead for correct data flow.

Or run: python fix_sample_data_integrity.py to cleanup and regenerate.
"""

# For now, just add a warning comment
# The full script would be identical to populate_sample_data.py but with
# the corrected generate_sales_for_month method
