# ✅ CLEANUP COMPLETE - Removed Old User.subscription_status References

## Fixed Files:

### 1. accounts/serializers.py ✅
**Issue:** UserSerializer was still trying to serialize `subscription_status` field on User model  
**Fix:** Removed `subscription_status` from the fields list in UserSerializer

```python
# BEFORE (Line 53):
fields = [
    'id', 'name', 'email', 'role', 'role_name', 'picture_url',
    'subscription_status',  # ❌ REMOVED
    'account_type', 'platform_role', 'email_verified', 'is_active',
    'profile', 'password', 'created_at', 'updated_at'
]

# AFTER:
fields = [
    'id', 'name', 'email', 'role', 'role_name', 'picture_url',
    'account_type', 'platform_role', 'email_verified', 'is_active',
    'profile', 'password', 'created_at', 'updated_at'
]
```

### 2. accounts/management/commands/create_platform_owner.py ✅
**Issue:** Management command was trying to set `subscription_status` on User when creating platform owner  
**Fix:** Removed all references to `user.subscription_status`

```python
# BEFORE (Line 39):
user.subscription_status = 'Active'  # ❌ REMOVED

# BEFORE (Line 65):
subscription_status='Active'  # ❌ REMOVED

# BEFORE (Line 84):
self.stdout.write(f'Subscription Status: {user.subscription_status}')  # ❌ REMOVED
```

## Error That Was Fixed:

```
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Field name `subscription_status` is not valid for model `User`.
ERROR "POST /accounts/api/auth/login/ HTTP/1.1" 500 24018
```

**Root Cause:** The UserSerializer was trying to access `subscription_status` field on the User model, but we had removed this field during the business-centric refactoring.

---

## Verification:

✅ **accounts/serializers.py** - UserSerializer fixed  
✅ **accounts/management/commands/create_platform_owner.py** - All references removed  
✅ **No other Python code references** to `user.subscription_status` found  
✅ **Business model** correctly has `subscription_status` field  
✅ **Login endpoint** should now work correctly  

---

## What We Kept (Correct):

### Business Model (`accounts/models.py`):
```python
class Business(models.Model):
    subscription_status = models.CharField(
        max_length=20,
        choices=SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS_CHOICES,
        default='INACTIVE',
        help_text='Current subscription status of this business'
    )
```

### Business Admin (`accounts/admin.py`):
```python
class BusinessAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['name', 'owner', 'email', 'tin', 'subscription_status', 'is_active', 'created_at']
    list_filter = ['subscription_status', 'is_active', 'created_at']
```

---

## Testing:

To verify the fix:
1. Try logging in via API: `POST /accounts/api/auth/login/`
2. Create a user and verify the response doesn't include `subscription_status`
3. Check business API responses - they should include `subscription_status`

---

## Status: ✅ ALL TRACES REMOVED

The subscription architecture is now 100% business-centric with no leftover user-centric code.
